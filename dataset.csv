Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"On behalf of my wife, family and government, I wish Muslims in Ghana and around the world Eid Mubarak. 

We thank Allah for seeing us through one month of fasting, prayer and devotion. I have no doubt that after nights of intense prayer and devotion, Allah would increase his favour upon our country and, insha Allah, by the next Ramadan our country would be better than it is today.

The month of Ramadan has certainly drawn us closer to Allah than we were before. It has also taught us the virtues of prayer, patience, piety and faith. These are virtues that we need all year round. I, therefore, urge all of us to hold fast to these values and not lose them merely because we are no longer in Ramadan. 
Above all, let the spirit of friendship, brotherhood and love that characterized our activities in Ramadan continue to influence our relationship with our fellow Ghanaians. With a sense of unity of purpose, we shall realize our goals.

I wish you a happy celebration and may Allah make our nation great and strong.",2017-06-25T15:59:27+0000,status,NA,NA,4115,172,203,4490

If we, Africans, are to transform our stagnant, jobless economies, built on the export of raw materials and unrefined goods, to value-added economies that provide jobs, to build strong middle-class societies and lift the mass of our people out of dire poverty, then we must take our destinies into our own hands and assume responsibility for this.",2017-06-12T16:42:07+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/nakufoaddo/photos/a.10155412153864836.1073742419.7893934835/10155412155774836/?type=3,"Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo added 22 new photos to the album: G20 Partnership for Africa Summit, in Berlin, Germany.",4282,131,418,4831

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"The impact of climate change on the oceans is alarming, and likely to exacerbate the existing impacts of anthropogenic activities in the marine environment.

The gradual warming of our oceans and increasing acidification, and their effects on the marine environment and resources, need to be addressed through the speedy implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which many Member States have signed and ratified, including Ghana, and which represents the blue print for global action to reverse this trend.

The recent announcement of the withdrawal of the USA from the agreement is a disturbing development, which Ghana believes, like the majority of the global community, requires urgent reconsideration by the new US administration. We have to work together to protect our planet.

The month of Ramadan is that in which the Qur'an was revealed and which has been instituted for Muslims to dedicate themselves to God and to the service of humankind. It is a month of intense devotion and commitment to the principles of love, sacrifice and dedication to duty.

I pray that in this month and beyond, we strive to live by these values, so that, even beyond Ramadan, we continue to commit ourselves to the good of humankind and our fellow Ghanaians. We have an opportunity to realize our potential as the Black Star of Africa, and it is my belief that the principles that Ramadan seeks to inculcate in Muslims are important for realizing this objective.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"We will set upon the path to build a Ghana that is not dependent on charity; a Ghana that is able to look after its people through intelligent management of the resources with which it has been endowed. This is our path, and this path offers a new Ghana.
This Ghana will be defined by integrity, sovereignty, a common ethos, discipline, and shared values. It is one where we aim to be masters of our own destiny, where we mobilise our own resources for the future, breaking the shackles of the Guggisberg economy and a mindset of dependency, bailouts and extraction. It is an economy where we look past commodities to position ourselves in a global marketplace. It is a country where we focus on trade, not aid, a hand-up, not a hand-out. It is a country that recognises the connectedness of its people and economy to those of its neighbours. This requires a forward-looking vision for our country, enabling us to confront our challenges and embrace our opportunities, not one fastened in the rear-view mirror. It is a Ghana beyond aid.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"My wife, Rebecca, my daughters, Gyankroma, Valerie, Dokua, my granddaughters and I extend our warmest greetings and best wishes to all Ghanaians celebrating Christmas. We join the millions across the world in recognising the sense of renewed hope this joyous season brings to us.

As we give and receive the goodwill of Christ in this Holy Season, let us be mindful of the true meaning of His life on earth, and especially of His greatest commandment: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind… and love your neighbor as yourself.” I, therefore, encourage all to remain committed to the cardinal principles of Christianity: love, charity and reconciliation.

I am aware of the many challenges that confronted Ghanaians this year. We should not see the economic difficulties of today as the blueprint of our tomorrow. There are brighter days ahead. We should continue to stay united and focus on the things that can help us construct the road to a brighter future.

We enhanced further our democratic credentials through the peaceful, dignified exercise of our democratic franchise. We have, once again, become the toast of the world. I, thus, urge each and every one of us not to do anything to jeopardise the peace and stability we are all enjoying. 

For my part, I am grateful to God for giving me the opportunity to serve Ghanaians in the coming years. I assure you that I am going to devote all my energies towards creating a free and prosperous society of opportunities, where every Ghanaian child, no matter the circumstances of their birth, has a fair chance to strive for a happy and dignified life, and where we can unleash the enterprise and creativity of our people so that we can build a progressive, prosperous Ghana whose citizens live in harmony and security. 

Let us all celebrate the season safely and responsibly, and remember to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves in this season of giving. Let our open hearts and warm smiles help feed those who are hungry and offer comfort to those in need. Let us take the time to gather, love, listen, and learn from each other, and to remember that together, and with the help of God, we can overcome any challenge and achieve any future of which we can dream.

I wish every Ghanaian a Merry Christmas. May the Good Lord bless Ghana and us all.",2016-12-25T12:13:27+0000,status,NA,NA,8762,687,593,10042

This is because Nana Akufo-Addo, Mahamudu Bawumia and the rest of the competent team of men and women, including my modest self, have spent our years in opposition constructively to perfect our agenda to create jobs, prosperity and equal opportunities for every man, woman or child in Ghana. Beyond that, we are led by Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo – a man of experience, a selfless, compassionate patriot who has seen it all; an achiever, who has proven over his long years of service to his nation that he has the wellbeing of our country and the welfare of her people always at heart and in mind."" ~ Boakye Agyarko",2016-10-26T17:50:47+0000,status,NA,NA,8758,183,199,9140

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""Just this month, the 2016 Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance, covering the decade from 2006-2016, tells us that Ghana, under the NDC, has racked up one of the fastest rates of deterioration in governance.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""Ghana is in crisis – avoidable, needless, annoying, Mahama-made crisis. A home-made crisis caused by a combination of incompetence, greed, corruption, visionlessness, recklessness, indecisive and insensitive leadership. Under John Dramani Mahama, Ghana has registered the biggest job losses ever on record. Not even the  PNDC retrenchments under the IMF structural adjustment programme of the 1980s recorded the kind of unemployment crisis Ghanaians have witnessed in the last three years alone. To reiterate, under John Dramani Mahama, we have suffered the longest period of dumsor on record. Latest figures from the Ghana Statistical Service show that Ghana’s economy (including oil) shrunk by $1.8 billion last year – the largest annual decrease in dollar terms on record. In fact, it is even projected to get worse this year. The Third Review under the IMF bailout agreement, which was published this month, projects the economy to grow by a mere 3.3% this year, the worst in 22 years. Please note, 3.3% is worse than the terrible economic situation (registering 3.7% then) that inspired Ghanaians to vote out the NDC in December 2000 after two terms in office, to usher in Positive Change under the able President John Agyekum Kufuor. After their current two terms, the NDC will be leaving office at the end of this year by registering the worst economic performance over an entire generation. What future can this group of proven nation wreckers build for you and your children? This is the question that every Ghanaian with a vote must consider as  we move closer to the polling booth on December 7."" ~ Boakye Agyarko",2016-10-26T15:00:22+0000,status,NA,NA,1527,66,104,1697
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""The NDC government plunged the country into a needless power crisis as a result of poor management and bad governance. This no doubt has significantly eroded the solid economic prospect of Ghana post 2008. In spite of these sad developments, the NDC government never saw the need to invest even one dollar to provide power for the people. All the megawatts of power generation claimed by the NDC are from projects implemented by the NPP, with a substantial portion of the projects funded with the Jubilee Bond of US$750 million. We can name some of the projects - Bui Hydro Power (400MW), TT1PP (126 MW), TT2PP (49MW), additional 108MW to the Akosombo Hydro Power, Kpone Thermal Plant (220MW) and the Mine Reserve Plant (80MW), among others. There were other private sector initiatives facilitated by government such as the Asogli Power Plant (200 MW with an expansion plan) and the 126 MW Osonor Thermal Power Plant (now CENIT). In all, the NPP invested and facilitated the addition of about 1000MW of generation capacity. Indeed, all the major achievements that the NDC boasts of in the energy sector today, including the discovery of oil, were done by the NPP and inherited by the NDC. Another typical example is the US$344 million US Exim Bank facility which they have used to extend nationwide coverage of electricity by an additional 30% under the Self Help Electrification (Shep IV) programme. This was approved by Parliament on 16th September 2008. The only modification done by the NDC was to facilitate the procurement of luxury vehicles as part of the loan agreement."" ~ Boakye Agyarko, NPP Policy Advisor, 26/10/16",2016-10-26T14:45:19+0000,status,NA,NA,1409,66,93,1568

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"THE STATE OF ROADS IN GHANA:
""As a result of the undue delay in paying for work done, the Ghanaian contractor and others are compelled to raise invoices for interest on all amounts that are delayed for payment in accordance with the conditions that govern the contracts. These amounts are huge and the longer the payments delay the closer the interest amounts approach or even equal the contract sums of the respective projects, thereby doubling the cost of the project.

""Most of the projects, therefore, become very expensive bearing in mind the mode of procurement. Consequently the cost effectiveness of the projects are eroded. For example, the NDC-led government expended huge sums of money in the road sector, specifically, US$1,929.13 million from January 2009 – January 2013, but achieved very little. Only 1190 km of road got tarred from January 2009 to January 2013 with this huge amount whereas NPP-led administration from January 2005 to January 2009 expended US$1282.56 million and tarred 3875 km of roads. In other words, the NPP used about 66% of the amount spent by the NDC to do about five times the stretch of road done by the NDC!! This means that if the NPP had the amount of US$1929.13 million which the NDC expended between 2009 – 2013 the NPP would have done 1955 km more, ie. done 5830 km and not the abysmal 1190 km done by the NDC!!"" ~ Minority in Parliament, 22/09/16",2016-10-24T11:35:52+0000,status,NA,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo updated his status.,1332,63,72,1467

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"SADA has been a monumental failure. It has been a vehicle for public money going down the drain. Money that should have been used to establish the basis of a performing agricultural sector in the North has gone into people’s pockets. 

In the December 2008 elections, I pledged to establish a Northern Development Authority (NoDA) and a Northern Development Fund, vehicles which will help bridge the developmental gap between the North and the South.

The then NDC vice presidential candidate, John Mahama, laughed at it. He said if I was talking from the back of my head, and that if I could find any monies for the Northern Development Fund, I should use that to pay the debts of VRA. When they came to power, they decided it was a good idea after all and brought us SADA.

Today, the President can tour the 3 regions of the North and cannot mention SADA – an initiative which he says is his baby. He cannot mention SADA anymore, because it has become a big failure. We are going to re-establish the NoDA and pay attention to the infrastructural deficit in the North.

On the occasion of Eid ul-Fitr, I urge all Muslims to please pray for the peace and prosperity of our nation. Pray for Allah to choose for Ghana, in this election year, a leadership of commitment, competence, and compassion.

I wish you well, as you celebrate Eid ul-Fitr.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"REDUCE ELECTRICITY TARRIFS NOW

I have taken notice of today’s statement made by the PURC that the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) should suspend its billing system. I think the matter is more fundamental and should go further than that. If you look at the rates we are charging, industry, as well as domestic users, for electricity in Ghana, compared, for instance, to Cote d’Ivoire, already, it puts our enterprises in a very uncompetitive comparison.

In Ghana, my understanding is that the tariff for commercial users is 32 US cents/kilowatt hour. The Ivorian equivalent is 13 US cents/kilowatt hour. Again, for domestic users, we are talking about 19.28 US cents/kilowatt hour, when Cote d’Ivoire equivalent is a tariff of 9 US cents/kilowatt hour. So, you put these things together, and, already, Ghanaian industry and economic activity are suffering unnecessarily. A large part of it is due to the taxes, the insatiable appetite of the Mahama government for taxes – 10% energy levy which is charged for both domestic and commercial uses; a service charge of GH¢7 flat rate for every consumer and a VAT of 17½% for commercial users. 

I believe all of these figures can be significantly reduced to be able to bring the electricity tariff system in our country to a much more competitive relationship with that of our neighbours and what is going on in the region. It is important for us to recognize in Ghana that, whatever we are doing, we are doing so in a globally competitive context, and if we don’t recognize that, many of the decisions we make about the management of our economy are going to put us at a disadvantage from the get go. 

I am saying it is absolutely imperative and urgent that the public authorities find a way to reduce electricity tariffs in our country immediately and do so now.",2016-05-24T16:05:31+0000,status,NA,NA,2599,256,265,3120

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Today, May 20, 2016, marks the first anniversary of the tragic death of Adams Mahama, the former Upper East Regional Chairman of the New Patriotic Party, who was senselessly and viciously murdered. 

It was a day the NPP lost a true blue party man, and a noble adherent of its principles and values.

It is not often that the party takes someone to its collective heart so wholeheartedly, but the late Adams Mahama managed to charm most people in the party. Adams was passionate about Ghana. He was convinced that the NPP will capture power in 2016 in order to improve the lives of the people of Ghana. It is up to us to make sure that Adams did not die in vain.

The way in which we will not let his death be in vain is to rededicate ourselves to the struggle ahead, that is the struggle to redeem our country and return her to the path of progress and prosperity. When we have done this and put the smiles back on the faces of all the poor and needy people that Adams took care of, only then would we have truly “avenged” his death.

The process of seeking justice is still ongoing in the courts and I urge the family of the late Adams Mahama and aggrieved members of the party to continue to trust the judicial system to bring a just resolution to the matter.

On this day, and on behalf of the entire membership of the NPP, we pledge to continue to work to keep the Adams’ flame alight. To his widow, children, and family, we pray for Allah’s continued strength for them.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"On the occasion of Easter, which marks the death and resurrection of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, I send best wishes to all Ghanaians, Christians, and members of the New Patriotic Party.

During the period of joy and celebration, I urge all believers to reflect on the important sacrifice Jesus Christ made for each of us on the Cross of Calvary. The resurrection of Jesus is the triumphant victory for every Christian. 

For us in Ghana, the festivities should be a time of renewed hope in the midst of the numerous challenges and economic difficulties confronting our country. Easter is the testimony of the possibility for a new life of hope. Thus, let us renew and strengthen our faith in God and continue to pray for a free and prosperous future for Ghana. I am confident that we can transform our nation and use all the blessings that the Almighty has bestowed on us to bring wealth to all our people, if we work at it.

To true adherents and members of the New Patriotic Party, I continue to advise that we conduct ourselves in a manner that underlines our commitment to the fact that there is hope for the future of our country. Ghanaians are looking to the NPP to win November’s elections and, thereby, speed up the development of our nation and the prosperity of every Ghanaian.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"I am deeply saddened and distraught by the news of the death of my lifelong friend, Jake Otanka Obetsebi Lamptey, which sad event occurred in the early hours of today, Palm Sunday, March 20, in London, in the United Kingdom.

The death of a friend of long standing brings up so many emotions – grief, sense of loss, reflections on friendship, the stark reality of mortality, and the presence of the Living God. Indeed, Jake and I grew up together and forged a close friendship in our childhood, very similar to that our fathers shared, which led to the significant roles they both played in the formation of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), the movement that initiated the struggle for Ghana’s freedom and independence. They were both members of the legendary Big Six of Ghanaian history. The UGCC is the mother party of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). The ties between us were considerable.

As a founding member of the NPP, Otanka, Jake to others, first served as Chairman of the Publicity Committee of the Party in 1992, and subsequently rose to the position of Greater Accra Regional Chairman. Candidate J.A Kufuor appointed him as his Campaign Manager in the successful election campaign of 2000. Again, in 2004, he was appointed Campaign Manager by President John Agyekum Kufuor in the campaign that led to the NPP retaining power that year. He served as President Kufuor’s first Minister for Presidential Affairs and Chief of Staff, and then subsequently as his Minister for Tourism and Modernization of the Capital, and also as his Minister for Information. Colleagues in the NPP government will readily attest to the dedication and selflessness with which he served Mother Ghana. His love for the party and desire to see the NPP regain power resulted in his election in 2010 as National Chairman of the NPP, but lost his bid for re-election in 2014. 

Undoubtedly, he made an immense contribution to the NPP and to Mother Ghana. A proud Ga, he was an honest, patriotic and distinguished son of Ghana, whose loyalty to Ghana was unalloyed, and who never wavered in his adherence to the values and principles of the Danquah-Dombo-Busia tradition, which was, for him, the noblest tradition in Ghanaian politics. He was, nevertheless, to his credit, a tolerant and responsible person who made many friendships across the political divide of our country.

A gregarious and fun-loving man, with an exceptional sense of humour, I will miss him immensely. I am confident all true devotees of the NPP and well-meaning Ghanaians will miss him too. 

A man with strong family values, I extend my deepest condolences and sympathies to his dear wife, Esther, and their children. 

May the soul of Jake Otanka Obetsebi Lamptey rest in perfect peace in the bosom of the Almighty until the last Day of the Resurrection when we meet again.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Like all Ghanaians, I have been deeply shocked and saddened by Sunday's news of a terrorist attack on the ancient Ivorian town of Grand Bassam, which led to the tragic loss of 16 lives and left dozens injured.

I condemn these despicable and cowardly attacks, and extend my deepest condolences to the families of the dead and wounded. 

This attack confirms the fears of many that terrorists are widening their scope of operations in West Africa, with Mali and Burkina Faso being recent targets, and is a stark reminder of the threat of global terrorism. We are, therefore, duty bound, as a member state of ECOWAS and as peaceful neighbours of the good people of Cote d’Ivoire, to help combat this menace. 

The Ivorian people, and, indeed, my good friend, President Alassane Ouattara, have the solidarity of all Ghanaians and of all peace-loving people in Africa. In times like these, citizens of Côte d'Ivoire need to be assured with deeds, not just words, that the world stands with them and stands ready to support them in the necessary fight against such evil. 

God bless Cote d’Ivoire, God bless Ghana and God bless Mother Africa.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"On behalf of the leadership and membership of the New Patriotic Party, I wish all Ghanaians a Happy Independence Anniversary celebration.

On this momentous occasion, it is critical that we take stock of what we have done with our freedom, and where we are now as a nation. Our forebears who fought to liberate us from colonial rule believed that freedom is the primary end, as well as the means to development, with the well-being of each and every individual as both the goal and means of development. 

It is unfortunate, however, that fifty-nine (59) years after gaining our independence, Ghana, a country blessed with an abundance of human and natural resources, is in a crisis – evidenced in widespread despondency, brought about by severe hardships, rising cost of living, high levels of youth unemployment, collapsed businesses, unprecedented strikes, demonstrations and increasing poverty. Surely, this is not the vision of Ghana our ancestors had hoped for. 

Let us, however, not despair and lose hope in the ability of our nation to offer her citizens a decent livelihood. Let us stride into the future confident that we will make it if we work at it. I am confident that we can transform our nation and use all the blessings that the Almighty has bestowed on us to bring prosperity to all our people. We can do it. God did not put us on this rich land to be poor. It is bad leadership that makes us poor.

Let us believe in Ghana and do what is right by our nation, and thereby fulfil the dreams and aspirations of those far-sighted individuals who initiated the steps for our national freedom and independence.

As we head to the polls, in this election year, it is important that we all work together, with our public institutions, to ensure that we have a level electoral playing field. We want free, fair and credible elections whose outcomes will be readily accepted by all. That is the best guarantee of the peace, stability and democracy of our country.
 
I salute and wish the people of Ghana a happy 59th Independence Anniversary.

It is tragic that our politics should sink to such levels that there appears to be nothing sacred, nor any respect for our cultural values in our society; and people would want to use the death of a loved one to defame a political opponent.

This story is nothing but a vile, repugnant and tasteless fabrication. We demand an unconditional and immediate retraction of story in the next edition of the paper, which comes out on Thursday, January 28, 2016.

The citizens of Burkina Faso deserve to go about their daily lawful activities without being terrorised by a group of cowardly people. I appeal to all Burkinabes to remain steadfast. They have the solidarity of the Ghanaian people and of all peace-loving people in Africa.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Fellow Ghanaians,
 
A new year is upon us, and we must all be thankful to the Almighty for His many mercies. I wish you all a happy and prosperous New Year, and best wishes for 2016.
 
This past year has been an eventful one for our country, perhaps one of the most difficult in our 58 year history. There has been widespread despondency, brought about by severe hardships, rising cost of living, high levels of youth unemployment, collapsed businesses and increasing poverty which is partly the result of a 4 year old energy crisis. Our country has become a byword for corruption.
 
There are millions of anxious Ghanaians going into 2016 with questions about where our nation is heading, and what the future holds. Certainly, this country, with an abundance of human and natural resources, deserves much better than what is currently on offer. We, the people of Ghana, have the power to bring about CHANGE in 2016, and return Ghana onto the path of progress and prosperity.
 
It is important in this election year that we all work together, with our public institutions, to ensure that we have a level electoral playing field. We want free, fair and credible elections whose outcomes will be readily accepted by all. That is the best guarantee of the peace, stability and democracy of our country.
 
Ghanaians are crying for change. The youth need to have hope again. I am confident that we can transform our nation and use all the blessings that the Almighty has bestowed on us to bring prosperity to all our people. We can do it. God did not put us on this rich land to be poor. It is bad leadership that makes us poor.
 
Let us rise and Change Ghana.  The Battle is the Lord’s.

Undoubtedly, 2015 has been a very difficult year for Ghanaians, amidst the numerous problems which face us. However, the story of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, must give us hope of a brighter tomorrow. 

I continue to be a passionate believer in Ghana’s potential, and I remain confident that, despite our present economic difficulties, we have it within us to rise up and revive the fortunes of our country. 

We must work towards creating a free and prosperous society of opportunities, where every Ghanaian child, no matter the circumstances of their birth, has a fair chance to strive for a happy and dignified life, and where we can unleash the enterprise of our people so that we can build a progressive, prosperous Ghana whose citizens live in harmony and security. 

As Christmas fills our hearts with gratitude, let us not forget our responsibility towards one another. Let us all celebrate the season safely and responsibly, and remember to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"On the occasion of the 2015 Farmers’ Day celebrations, I join many other Ghanaians in expressing our sincere appreciation to our farmers and fisherfolk for their hard work and commitment to the cause of building Mother Ghana over the years.

The role of agriculture in transforming any economy and nation is vital. If we are to make any meaningful change in the lives of the people, our efforts must be directed at this sector. The majority of people can only feel a change in their lives when we develop agriculture rapidly.

However, the agriculture sector has been neglected under the NDC government over the last 7 years. Budgetary allocation to the sector has been reducing consistently – from 3% in 2009 to 1.1%, as contained in the 2016 budget. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that growth rate in the sector, which stood at 7.4% at the end of 2008, when the NPP left office, is now a dismal 0.04%. 

With modernisation and diversification of agriculture being a key component of the NPP’s 4-Point Agenda for the development of Ghana, I wish to assure our farmers and fisherfolk that the blessing of oil will not distract an Akufo-Addo-led NPP government from making the agricultural sector more sophisticated, more productive and more efficient. Access to finance, improved training and technology, reducing post-harvest losses, extending feeder roads and farm tracts to as many farm gates as possible, increasing irrigation facilities, and guaranteeing markets for our farm produce are going to be the nucleus of this approach. 

I congratulate all award winners in this year’s National Best Farmers' Day Awards and I hope that your exploits and achievements would be an inspiration for others to the benefit of the Ghanaian people. 

God bless our farmers and fisherfolk.
God bless Ghana.",2015-12-04T13:33:03+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/nakufoaddo/photos/a.499066124835.277652.7893934835/10153738980929836/?type=3,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo with Asare Simon and 3 others.,5523,315,356,6194

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"This is to congratulate M. Roch Marc Christian Kabore on his election as the President of Burkina Faso, after securing 53.5% of valid votes in the general elections of Sunday, November 29, 2015.

I also commend his main challenger, M. Zephirin Diabre, for graciously conceding defeat, thereby laying to rest any lingering suspicion and anxiety about the fate of Burkina Faso in the aftermath of the elections, the first election since the departure of President Blaise Compaore. The interim President, M. Michel Kafando, is equally to be commended for his role in steering the affairs of the country, putting in place a transitional process and organising elections in accordance with the Transition Charter.

The peaceful nature of the polls has demonstrated the determination of the people of Burkina Faso to living in a democratic state where they alone, through the ballot box, will have the power to decide who their leaders are.

I wish the President-elect and the people of Burkina Faso the very best of luck, and pray for the country’s success in the years to come. 

It is my hope that the relations between Burkina Faso and Ghana will also grow from strength to strength under the Presidency of M. Roch Marc Christian Kabore.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Shakespeare’s inimitable language, in the mouth of Mark Anthony, during his celebrated funeral oration for Julius Ceasar, captures the relationship I had with the late Alhaji Aliu Mahama: “He was my friend, faithful and just to me.” Dependable friend, faithful colleague, just leader – the attributes of Aliu Mahama.

Today, November 16, 2016, marks three years of the death of Alhaji Aliu Mahama – a day when Ghana lost a patriot and dignified public servant. 

Indeed, the first of his faith in our history to occupy the high office of Vice President of the Republic, his conduct in that office was a credit to all Moslems, and, indeed, to all Ghanaians. Proud Dagomba, he personified the best traits of the Ghanaian character – honest, patriotic, responsible, tolerant.

It is not often that the New Patriotic Party takes someone to its collective heart so wholeheartedly, but the late Alhaji Aliu Mahama managed to charm most people in the party. 

We met some twenty four years ago in Tamale when I was busy helping to organise the expansion of the Danquah Busia Memorial Club in preparation for the formation of the New Patriotic Party. He had an open house for all and sundry, especially for adherents of our common tradition. I recognised, from the outset, his deep attachment to the values and principles of the Danquah-Dombo-Busia political tradition – the values of fairness and opportunity, commitment to individual freedom and human rights, respect for the rule of law and the principles of democratic accountability, and confidence in a dynamic market economy as the best vehicle for generating prosperity for the mass of our people.

The cordial relations between us survived even our competition for the leadership of the party, and lasted till the unfortunate end. Three years on, I still feel a deep, personal loss. 

On this day, and on behalf of the entire membership of the NPP, we pledge to work to keep the Aliu flame alight. To his widow, Hajia Ramatu Aliu Mahama, and the family, we pray for Allah’s continued strength for them. I am certain Aliu will have a smile on his face knowing that his son, Farouk, has named his new-born 2-week old son Aliu Mahama, in his honour.

May the Almighty Allah continue to bless him and grant him eternal rest.

The 58% margin of victory chalked by President Conde in the October 18 election is, indeed, an affirmation of the confidence the Guinean people have reposed in him, after a lifetime spent in the struggle for democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, and for solidarity amongst the African peoples.
 
By the result of this election, the Guinean people have also strengthened their democratic credentials, following the positive history they made by electing for the first time, in 2010, their national leader within the context of democratic principles and multi-party competition.
 
I wish President Conde and the Guinean people the very best of luck in the years to come, as Guinea unleashes her tremendous potential to develop into a thriving, prosperous democratic state.
 
It is my hope that the relations between Guinea and Ghana will grow from strength to strength in the second term of Alpha Conde’s presidency.

According to a release by the Party, “by the decision of the NEC, Mr. Paul Afoko is suspended indefinitely from the position of National Chairman of the NPP.”

I profoundly regret that matters have come to this. Such a development has been rather rare in the history of our party.  I had hoped that internal discussions and a spirit of cooperation would have enabled the Party to avoid such an eventuality. 

However, the appropriate organs of the Party have acted. I am, therefore, calling on all loyal members of the Party to respect the decision of NEC and the Constitution of the Party, which provides channels for redressing grievances. We need to conduct ourselves in a disciplined manner that will protect and promote the integrity and unity of the Party.

The NPP requires a united and committed front for the task ahead. We need to stay focused and organise ourselves to prosecute a successful campaign in 2016 to relieve the Ghanaian people from their sufferings and hardships. Ghanaians are looking up to us.
 
God bless the NPP

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"It is instructive to note that on March 25, 2015, President John Mahama, then Chairman of ECOWAS, intervened in a political dispute in neighbouring Togo by requesting the postponement of the election originally scheduled for April 15 to May 25, 2015. His intervention was in response to calls from Togo’s opposition parties over the credibility of the voters’ register, which they alleged was bloated. Indeed, President Mahama urged the Togolese authorities to agree to establish a credible voters’ register, arguing that it was important Togo went into the election with a register which enjoyed the confidence of all parties. This request was heeded. The peaceful acceptance of the election result by stakeholders in Togo is indicative of how appropriate the President’s intervention was. Clearly, what is good for Togo must be good for Ghana.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO APPEALS TO GOVERNMENT AND DOCTORS TO RESUME NEGOTIATIONS

For nearly two weeks now, the people of Ghana have looked on helplessly and been in a state of extreme anxiety as a healthcare system already under a lot of strain has almost shut down with a strike by medical doctors. A strike action by members of the Ghana Medical Association affects the majority of citizens as it is the GMA members who are the doctors in the public hospitals on which we all rely for our health needs. 

This strike has been occasioned by the breakdown in the negotiations between the government and the GMA over the ‘Conditions of Service’ for medical doctors.

It is most unfortunate that these negotiations should have been allowed to degenerate into the lack of confidence and display of bad faith that would lead to a strike. It goes without much argument that medical doctors as a group of professionals do not easily resort to strike action. And it is important that all those who seek to comment on the problem, especially those who speak on behalf of government, avoid the name calling that has characterised government’s handling of the dispute so far. It is absurd that some members of government are seeking to politicise this strike by portraying the NPP as being the instigators. It is an insult to the intelligence and integrity of the thousands of doctors in this country.  

The only path to a resolution of the problem is for both parties to return to the negotiation table. The doctors are negotiating to get the best terms as possible for their members, but they are not unreasonable nor are they economically illiterate. They are not unaware of the dire economic situation that Ghana is in as the result of the reckless mismanagement by this government. It is for this reason that they have stated that their proposals are for the 2016 budget. This should give government ample space to consider and, after negotiations are concluded, incorporate what is agreed in the 2016 budget.

Government negotiators should deal with the doctors as patriotic, knowledgeable, mature adults. The media war and selective leaking of negotiating documents should cease. The intimidation and threats should cease and the name calling should cease. The problem we face will not be solved even if all retired doctors should be drafted into our hospitals; the prospect of hiring retired doctors should therefore not be held out as part of the negotiations. The solution does not lie in asking people to go to private medical centres that accept National Health Insurance; many such institutions are already opting out of the scheme with the continued difficulty in paying for the services. 

There cannot, and there will not be a resolution other than getting the doctors back to work. There is nothing to be gained from trying to call the bluff of the doctors. It is in all our interests that a negotiated settlement is found as quickly as possible. That will only happen when both sides go back to the table and negotiate in an atmosphere of mutual respect and a realization of the urgency of the situation.

I would respectfully tell the President of the Republic that Government cannot hide behind the IMF bailout programme to frustrate these important negotiations. The IMF programme seeks rightly to manage the government’s own home grown problem of fiscal imbalance created by the NDC over the last few years. A component of this is to limit the nominal increase in the total wage bill to 10 percent, supported by, among other measures, strict limits on net hiring in the public sector, which invariably affects emoluments. However, it is instructive to note that this freeze excludes the education and health sectors. Yet, over 2,000 qualified nurses and midwives are at home and have not been employed even though they are needed desperately by health facilities across the nation. If the IMF programme can recognise the fact these two sectors provide critical social services that must be protected and improved, then the least Ghanaians expect is for Government not to see negotiations on conditions of service with health workers in a negative light.
 
In the meantime, precious lives are being lost and a sense of fear and helplessness is pervading our nation. Our healthcare situation is not good even at the best of times and this standoff between the government and the GMA aggravates an already perilous state of affairs. Accidents and diseases are no respecter of persons or titles and we are all at risk and cannot afford to have the strike drag on. As the GMA meets on Friday, I pray that they be guided by their known professionalism and I urge the members to go back to the hospitals to demonstrate the goodwill that they have always displayed.     

The Government on its part should realize that in matters of life and death, no one has the right to walk away from negotiating. I urge Government, and the Ghana Medical Association, to sit down until an agreement is reached. An agreement can be reached and must be reached.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"ON THE 68TH ANNIVERSARY OF U.G.C.C. FORMATION

August 4 is a special day in the history of our country. It is the date which shaped and determined the course of our collective history – setting the stage for an organised front for Ghana’s independence struggle. 

On August 4, 1897, we witnessed the establishment in Cape Coast of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society by the great Ghanaian patriots, John Mensah Sarbah, Joseph Casely Hayford and others, which successfully fought the British colonial power to maintain indigenous control of our lands.

On the same day, 50 years later, at Saltpond, the great nationalists of the time, George Alfred “Paa” Grant, J B Danquah, Francis Awoonor-Williams, R S Blay, George More, R S Wood, J W de Graft Johnson, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey, Ebenezer Ako Adjei, William Ofori-Atta, Edward Akufo-Addo, and Cobbina Kessie, together with paramount chiefs, clergymen, lawyers, entrepreneurs, teachers, traders and men and women from all walks of life in the Gold Coast gathered to inaugurate the United Gold Coast Convention, UGCC of blessed memory, the first political party of the Gold Coast, formed to spearhead the fight for national independence. 

All the subsequent events which followed - the 1948 riots in Accra, the establishment of the Watson Commission, the formation of the Convention People's Party, the setting up of the Coussey Constitutional Committee and, ultimately, the attainment of independence on March 6, 1957 - flowed from the activities of that day.

We must continue to honour this day, and the men and women who participated in these historic events which led to our national independence.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"The 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says he remains confident of victory in the 2016 election, despite the ‘disappointing’ result of the Tuesday, July 7, 2015, by-election in Talensi, which saw the NDC reclaiming the seat only won by the NPP’s Robert Mosore in 2012.

According to Nana Akufo-Addo, the attitude and the commitment of NPP Members of Parliament, national officers, regional, constituency and polling station executives, and the entire membership of the party towards the Talensi by-election were very encouraging, and indicative of the fact that the NPP is determined to work hard for victory in 2016.

“The results were not what we were expecting, but I am not too worried about that, especially as it was a traditional NDC seat. I am interested in the morale and the attitude of our party members that were on display in the campaign and on the day. The results are disappointing, but the work that was done, coupled with the attitude and commitment of our people towards the work ahead in 2016, was very encouraging,” Akufo-Addo said.

The NPP flagbearer made this known when 5 newly-elected parliamentary candidates, together with their constituency chairmen and the unsuccessful parliamentary aspirants, from the Aowin, Bia East, Bia West, Bodi and Juaboso constituencies, all in the Western Region, called on him at his Nima residence, on Wednesday, July 8, to introduce themselves formally to him.

In his remarks to the newly-elected candidates, Akufo-Addo appealed to them to adopt, what he describes as, the ‘Talensi Model’ in their respective constituencies, in the run-up to the campaign for 2016.  

Explaining the ‘Talensi Model’, Nana Akufo-Addo stated that “all the NPP aspirants who contested in the Talensi primaries were all together in the campaign. The aspirants who lost to Thomas Duanab were with him everywhere and it helped our campaign. They showed the way, which was that, ‘we are all going to campaign for Duanab’.”

This model, according to Akufo-Addo, must be replicated in all 275 constituencies across the country if the NPP is to be victorious in 2016.

He also urged all NPP members, sympathisers and well-wishers not to be discouraged by the Talensi result, as “this seat was not traditionally our seat.

“We shouldn’t be discouraged. We all witnessed the blatant abuse of incumbency in Talensi, to the extent that the entire government machinery, including State-sponsored violence, descended on this constituency all in the bid to win a by-election. On the contrary, I was impressed by the attitude and morale shown by our party members. If we can replicate this, it will help us a lot,” he added.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"The 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says no single person within his party wants any harm to befall the President of the Republic, John Dramani Mahama, with some 16 months to the holding of the 2016 general elections.

According to Nana Akufo-Addo, contrary to the reasons given by the hierarchy of the Ghana Police Service in the Upper East Region that President Mahama will not be safe in Talensi should the NPP hold a rally on the same day as the ruling NDC, the NPP wants President Mahama alive and well, so Ghanaians can vote him out of power in 2016.

Nana Akufo-Addo made this known when he addressed a mammoth rally at Winkogo, in the Talensi constituency, on Sunday, July 5, 2015, signifying the end of official campaigning for all political parties ahead of the July 7 by-election. 

 “They did not want us to have this rally, but in the end we are having it. The Police said that because the President is here, he will not be safe if we have our rally. We want to tell the Police and Mr. President that there is nobody in the NPP who would want anything to happen to him,” Nana Akufo-Addo said to loud cheers from the thousands of NPP supporters and symapthisers who had congregated from Winkogo, Duusi, Tongo Nayiri, Gorogo, Gbani, Baare, Pwalugu, Balungu, Sheaga, amongst others, at the rally grounds.

He continued, “We don’t want anything to happen to him. We want him to be safe and well so that next year in December, we can have the pleasure of voting him out of power. Then, he can spend four years watching what a party with the plan and the programme can do to bring prosperity and upliftment to the Ghanaian people.”

Flanked by his running mate, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia; the NPP’s candidate for Talensi, Thomas Duanab Wuni; and the Upper East Regional NPP Chairman, Murtala Mohammed, Nana Akufo-Addo stated that victory in the Talensi by-election for the NPP “will be the best signal to the world that, indeed, the elephant is on the move and, God-willing, the elephant will be back in the Jubilee House in 2017.”

Akufo-Addo assured the people of Talensi, and, indeed, all Ghanaians that the NPP is coming back to power because the party has a plan for the development of all sections of the country.

This plan, he explained, is one that is going to bring jobs for the teeming masses of unemployed Ghanaian youth, improve the country’s agriculture, which will in turn strengthen Ghanaian farmers, and also develop Ghana’s industrial potential.

“That is the plan that we have to transform the lives of the people of Ghana and bring prosperity and progress to the Ghanaian people,” he said, adding that “our programme is not about propaganda, lies, stealing and the mismanagement of the affairs of the people of this country. We are for progress, development and improving the lives of the people of Ghana.”

In the estimation of Nana Akufo-Addo, Ghana, a country rich in human and natural resources, has her citizens being poor “because we have poor leadership.”

When Ghana gets good leadership, he said, “like we saw in Kufuor’s time, we can see what it does in improving the economy and standards of living of the people of our country. And that is why we are coming back.”

He assured the people of Ghana that the NPP is coming back not to steal the money of the people of Ghana.

“I am not into politics to enrich myself. That is not why I am in politics. We are coming to serve the people of Ghana because we know that with good, honest and competent leadership, we can make this country into what it was destined to be – a rich, powerful and progressive nation, the Black Star of the African continent,” Nana Akufo-Addo reiterated

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"“Even though chiefs do not take part in partisan politics, you vote. So I'm here to ask you to vote for my candidate, Thomas Duanab, in next Tuesday’s by-election. I am also here to introduce myself to you, as the presidential candidate of the NPP for 2016. As you all know I'm a great friend of the Upper East, and I am here to get your support for the NPP in Tuesday's election and also for the 2016 election.”

These were the words of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic, on Saturday, July 4, marking ‘Day 2’ of his campaign for the NPP candidate in the Talensi by-election, Thomas Duanab Wuni.  

Addressing Chiefs and opinion leaders from Winkogo, Balungu, Pwalugu and Yinduri, in separate meetings, Nana Akufo-Addo explained that the purpose for his presence in Talensi was to “help find a successor to the Paramount Chief, Tongo-Raana Kolbilsong Namalteng”, who was the immediate past NPP Member of Parliament for the constituency. 

The NPP leader informed the Chiefs that he had been in Talensi since Friday, and the purpose of his visit to them was to “come to try and persuade you, and the people of Talensi to vote for Thomas Duanab. It is because of this that I am going round the constituency, meeting important people such as yourselves.” 

Accompanied by new Upper East Regional Chairman, Murtala Mohammed; Upper West Regional Chairman, Alhaji Abubakr Rahaman; Northern Regional NPP Chairman, Daniel Bugri Naabu; Eastern Regional NPP Chairan, Kiston Akomeng Kissi; former Minister of Finance under the Kufuor government and leading member of the NPP, Yaw Osafo Maafo; Akufo-Addo assured the Chiefs that the NPP has in place programmes and policies for the development of the nation, when voted into power in 2016.

“We have a big plan for the development of our country”, he said, adding that “this will make it easy for you as Chiefs, as we will give all the young men in your area, jobs. The NPP is coming to help the people of Ghana and I can assure you that I am not coming to put Ghana’s money in my pocket.”

On the NPP’s Talensi candidate, Mr. Thomas Doanab, popularly known as ‘Home Boy’, Nana Akufo-Addo urged the Chiefs, opinion leaders and constituents to vote for him because he is “an honest and competent man and he’ll be a good representative of yours in parliament. He is a good man.”

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has urged the electorate in Talensi to vote for the New Patriotic Party’s candidate for the July 7 by-election, Thomas Doanab, as this will be a vote in honour of the Paramount Chief of Talensi, Tongo-Raana Kolbilsong Namalteng, who is also known in private life as Robert Nachinab Mosore, the NPP’s immediate past Member of Parliament for the constituency.

The NPP’s 2016 presidential candidate made this known on Friday, July 3, 2015, when he campaigned in Gbane, Duusi and Sheaga, all in the Talensi constituency, ahead of next Tuesday’s by-election.

According to Akufo-Addo, “by voting for Thomas Doanab, you will continue to honour the legacy of Robert Mosore.”

Ghanaians, and indeed the people of Talensi, he said, have had enough of the suffering imposed on them by the Mahama-led NDC government, and as such are in desperate need of a change in government.

“Ghanaians acknowledge that the NDC, even if they are in power for 50 years, cannot bring jobs, progress and prosperity. So all I am asking for is that you vote for Thomas Doanab as MP for Talensi, and in 2016 for Akufo-Addo, and the NPP will bring jobs, progress and development to our country,” Akufo-Addo said.

He assured the constituents of Talensi that “the NPP is coming back to power not to steal your money. That is not why we are coming to power. The NPP is coming because we have a plan to develop this country, so we can bring progress and prosperity to all parts of Ghana. We are coming so the young people of our country can get work to do and our farmers can be strong again.”

To bring this to fruition, he maintained that “we have the men and women who can give this country a first class government”, stressing that “I am not in politics to put money in my pocket, that is not why I am in politics. We are coming into power to help develop this beautiful land. We are entitled to be a prosperous nation, not a poor country. 

On the NPP’s candidate for the by-election, Mr. Thomas Doanab, popularly known as ‘Home Boy’, Nana Akufo-Addo urged the constituents to vote for him because he is “an honest and competent man and he’ll be a good representative of yours in parliament.
Visit to Chiefs and opinion leaders 

Nana Akufo-Addo, together with his team, and prior to hitting the campaign trail, paid a courtesy call on the Paramount Chief of Talensi, Tongo-Raana Kolbilsong Namalteng, to inform him formally of his presence in the constituency, as he campaigns for Thomas Doanab.

The NPP flagbearer congratulated the Tongo-Raana on his elevation to his new status, stating that “the people of Talensi are very lucky to have you, and I have no doubt that under your leadership, the people of Talensi will prosper.”

He introduced the NPP’s candidate for the by-election to the gathering, and in the presence of the Paramount Chief stated that “your legacy requires that Thomas Doanab wins on Tuesday. That is what will bring you glory.”

The Tongo Raana, on his part, thanked Nana Akufo-Addo and his team for their visit, stating that though all the parliamentary candidates are his “children”, what the people of Talensi need is “an MP who will follow in my footsteps.”

Earlier in the day, Nana Akufo-Addo also called on the Chiefs of Gbane, Sheaga and Dusi, where he also introduced the NPP’s candidate to them.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"The 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on Thursday, July 2, 2015, came to the aid of 50 residents of Old Fadama, popularly referred to as ‘Sodom and Gomorrah’, who had indicated their desire to return home to the North after the demolition exercise of the settlement undertaken by the Mahama-led NDC government.

The residents, who had been tagged as ‘NPP supporters’ by officials of government in-charge of ensuring the transportation of Old Fadama residents desirous of returning to the North, and as such had been left to their own fate, had congregated at the National Headquarters of the party in search of assistance.

The residents who had earlier gathered at the Nima residence of the NPP flagbearer, but met his absence, moved to the NPP headquarters in search of assistance.

Upon hearing the news and moved by the plight of the residents, who were largely made up of women and babies, Nana Akufo-Addo immediately went to the NPP headquarters and interacted with them.

Whilst interacting with them, he learnt that most of the residents affected by the demolition exercise had, literally, been abandoned by the Mahama government, with the excuse that they were members of the NPP. 

Akufo-Addo, after learning of their predicament, donated a cash amount of GH¢5,000, being the cost of hiring a bus to take them to the North, and subsequently to their respective homes in the North.

He condemned the alleged discrimination that had been employed by the government officials towards them, stating that “this is not how a country is governed.”

Akufo-Addo stated that “this issue is an issue that has affected Ghanaians. There is no need, whatsoever, for the segregation of residents into ‘NPP’ and ‘NDC’, as is being done by government officials. This is not right. What has happened is not pleasant, but it has already occurred, and I urge you to take heart.”

He continued, “Once you have decided to go home, please do well to make a living for yourselves. I pray for travelling mercies for you, and may God be with you.”

The National Women’s Organiser of the NPP, Otiko Afisa Djaba, who was also present, was tasked by the NPP flagbearer to ensure a bus was found to enable the 50 return home safely.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, has stated that, contrary to the propaganda being peddled by political opponents of the NPP, there will never be any form of marginalisation of any ethnic group in Ghana under a future Akufo-Addo government, should Ghanaians give him the mandate in January 2017.

According to him, all Ghanaians, regardless of where they hail from, will have a pride of place in Ghana, as development, and the improvement of living standards for all will be the main focus of his government.

Receiving a delegation from the Binduri constituency on Monday, June 29, led by the newly elected parliamentary candidate, Abanga Abdullahi, who told the NPP flagbearer about a vicious campaign being waged by opponents of the NPP that Kussasi settlers in the South will be sent to the North when an NPP government under Nana Akufo-Addo takes over in 2016, this is what the NPP flagbearer had to say: 

“The NPP is not on any tribal agenda and has no tribal agenda. Every single group will be secure in Ghana. We are One Ghana and I am totally committed to working to ensure peace and unity for the Ghana project,” he said.

He continued, “whether you are a Fante, Ga, Ewe, Akan, Kussasi, Mamprusi, Bimoba or whatever ethnic group you belong to, Ghana belongs to all of us. No ethnic group will be marginalised under Akufo-Addo, and the track record of the NPP in this regard speaks for itself.”

Nana Akufo-Addo recalled the same propaganda being played against the NPP in the run-up to the 2000 elections, when political opponents stated that the NPP, under John Agyekum Kufuor, will marginalise and, in the end, “sack some ethnic groups from Ghana.”

“In the end it was all lies. President Kufuor oversaw one of the biggest transformations of Ghana in all parts of the country. No ethnic group was marginalised and I can assure all Ghanaians that, under an Akufo-Addo government, no ethnic group will be slighted in anyway whatsoever,” he added.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"The newly-elected parliamentary candidate for the Adenta constituency, Lawyer Yaw Buaben Asamoa, says Ghanaians have come to understand that it is only an Akufo-Addo led NPP government that can rescue them from the economic hardships, widespread and rampant corruption, and rising levels of unemployment the country has been experiencing under President Mahama and his NDC government.

He disclosed this when he paid a courtesy call on Nana Akufo-Addo at his Nima residence on Monday, June 22, 2015, to formally introduce himself as the NPP’s parliamentary candidate for Adenta in the 2016 election.

Accompanied by a large entourage, made up of polling station and constituency executives, and electoral area co-ordinators, Yaw Buaben Asamoa explained that “the people of Ghana are fed up, they want to try you (Akufo-Addo). It is not about governance anymore, because the people of Ghana now understand that we (NPP) can deliver governance.  It is now about getting us into power.”

He stated further that, “Adenta wants you in power. When you are in power, we will also be there with you, and we are going to make sure that we help (to make it a reality).”

 

On the 2016 parliamentary election, Yaw Buaben Asamoa noted that the feeling in Adenta is that the NPP must reclaim the seat, which it lost in 2008 to the NDC.

“We have a great opportunity, this time, to win”, he said, adding that “inspite of us all not being here, we believe that everything will come together as we go along. I want to pledge that I will work with them (constituency executives), I will listen to them, I will follow their instructions, build a coalition of the willing, and, Insha Allah, we will deliver the Adenta seat.”

Nana Akufo-Addo, who was pleased by the show of brotherliness amongst the executives and the newly-elected parliamentary candidate, further urged all NPP members and sympathisers in the constituency “to support him. I am appealing to all of you to stand firmly behind him and I am confident victory shall be ours in 2016.”

He congratulated Yaw Buaben Asamoa on his victory, going on to describe him as “a young man whose profile in the party keeps rising higher and higher.”

In concluding, Nana Akufo-Addo admonished the gathering, and indeed all NPP members, to desist from always resorting to the use of the media in airing out grievances pertaining to internal party issues.

“If there are things you have to say which are critical in nature, please do it indoors. If there is anything you have to say to him, be it an advice or criticism, please meet him one-on-one and thrash them out. Let’s move away from always sending all our problems to the radio and the newspapers,” he said.

As we await the outcome of the investigation, WAEC should be more vigilant in the processing of the examination papers to prevent the recurrence of this incident.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"The newly elected parliamentary candidate of the Madina constituency on the ticket of the New Patriotic Party, Hon. Boniface Abubakr Saddique, has assured Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and well as the rank and file of the party of his determination to annex the Madina seat for the NPP in the 2016 election.

According to him, though the Madina constituency has never been won by the NPP since the restoration of multi-party democracy in 1992, he is of the firm belief that with the current level of unity prevailing amongst members, delegates and executives of the party, coupled with his strong message and vision of what Madina can be under an Akufo-Addo led NPP government, he is convinced the electorate in the constituency will vote for him to become its Member of Parliament in 2016.

Hon. Boniface Saddique made this known when, with a large entourage, he paid a courtesy call on the 2016 presidential candidate of the NPP on Wednesday, June 17, 2015, to introduce himself to him as the new Madina NPP parliamentary candidate.

“I made this pledge to the delegates prior to the primaries and I want to reaffirm it again. Madina will be counted in 2016 as one of the seats belonging to the NPP. We will win Madina, Insha Allah. I want to assure Nana Akufo-Addo, Ghana’s President-in-waiting, that his vote share in Madina will increase. Akufo-Addo will win in Madina, Boniface will also win in Madina,” he said to loud applause from the gathering.

As a sign of the unity prevailing in the constituency after the primaries, Hon. Boniface Saddique was accompanied to the Nima residence of the NPP flagbearer by all the five aspirants who contested Saturday’s primary.

All five aspirants, who took turns to address the gathering, pledged their support for the candidature of Hon. Boniface Saddique and reassured him, in the presence of Nana Akufo-Addo, of their unflinching support, whilst at the same time working to ensure that the NPP flagbearer wins the mandate of Ghanaians in 2016.

Nana Akufo-Addo, encouraged by the show of camaraderie amongst the delegates and executives from Madina, thanked them for their visit and their pledges of support ahead of the 2016 election.

“On my part, I can also say that I have full confidence in Boniface, the man you have elected as your parliamentary candidate. He is an experienced politician. I am sure that, together, we will work hard for victory in 2016. I have known him for many years, as we worked together under President Kufuor,” Akufo-Addo said.

To the delegates and party executives present, Nana Akufo-Addo had a word of advice for them.

“Our internal contests are almost over. We have a few more constituencies which are yet to conduct their parliamentary primaries. Let us all remember that this talk of this person is a ‘Nana man’, that person is an ‘Alan man’ is no longer relevant. We are all members of the NPP, and I am going to work with all members of the party. Boniface was part of Alan’s team and did not support me; today he is the parliamentary candidate for Madina. We are going to work together. We have to deliver Ghana from the failing government of Mahama’s NDC and bring back progress and prosperity to our country. We can only do that if we are all working together in sincerity,” he concluded.",2015-06-19T15:14:29+0000,link,http://thestatesmanonline.com/index.php/politics/1177-npp-will-annex-madina-in-2016-boniface-assures-akufo-addo,NA,1760,70,23,1853

I continue to reiterate that education is a matter of the greatest importance to the prosperity and welfare of any society. If we seek to transform our country into a modern productive player in the global market, education and skills training of our young people are the surest bet. Quality, accessible education is the key. I am asking our students to seize this opportunity with both hands and open the door to their own and Ghana’s bright future.

Good luck! God bless!

I congratulate all party executives, delegates and aspirants for the peaceful, credible, efficient and successful manner in which the elections, the last in the series of our internal contests, were conducted. They were exciting and competitive. The high level of participation, enthusiasm and camaraderie that the elections generated among our activists gives an indication of our collective energy and commitment to the struggle ahead in 2016.

Internal party contests are not about winners and losers. They are about the party winning.

Thus, in the true spirit of our party’s tradition, I urge all party members and sympathisers to rally behind their respective parliamentary candidates to strengthen further our resolve and singleness of purpose to capture power in 2016. I also respectfully appeal to those who were successful on the day to reach out and bring on board their fellow aspirants who did not win. Unsuccessful aspirants should in their turn also reciprocate this gesture. To the sitting MPs who lost, I applaud their service to our party and nation and ask them not to be disheartened. They have important roles to play in the forward march of the party.

For the great majority of Ghanaians, the NPP is the obvious alternative to the failing government of the Mahama-led NDC. It is for us to show them that we can win the 2016 elections, so that we can take our nation out of the desperate conditions into which she has been plunged and put her back onto the path of progress and prosperity. We must forge ahead, in a united manner, in our quest to restore hope to Ghanaians. This is our sacred duty. Let us be up and doing.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"The 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has moved to reconcile constituency and regional executives, as well as several youth groups, sympathetic to the party, after seeming divisions emerged in the wake of the tragic death of the late Alhaji Adams Mahama, former Chairman in the Upper East Region.

It will be recalled that the murder of the late NPP Chairman triggered, in its wake, an avalanche of events which resulted, amongst others, in some regional executives of the party being classified as “persona non-grata” by some members belonging to NPP youth groups, who believed that these executives were against Adams Mahama.

However, after the Adua held for Adams Mahama at the Jubilee Park in Bolgatanga, on Sunday, June 7, 2015, Nana Akufo-Addo held discussions with NPP executives and the four major “youth bases” in Bolgatanga, a move described by party faithful as leading to the restoration of peace and brotherliness to the NPP in the Upper East Region

Together with members of his team, the NPP leader, first, met all 15 constituency chairpersons. He listened to their grievances and assured them of his continued support for the region in these difficult times. The chairpersons, in turn, pledged to continue with the plans laid down by the late Adams Mahama, which included annexing at least 8 out of 15 seats in Parliament from the region, and also ensuring that Nana Akufo-Addo’s share of votes in the 2016 presidential election increases significantly in the region.

At the same venue, and after meeting the constituency chairpersons, Nana Akufo-Addo met with 13 out of the 15 regional executives, including those who had gone into hiding after the death of Adams Mahama, after being accused by some irate party youth of working against the late Chairman.

In the meeting, Nana Akufo-Addo stated that his main priority was the guaranteeing of the security of all the regional executives, as well as ensuring togetherness amongst the executives prevailed. This, according to him, is the only way the Party can prosecute a successful campaign in memory of the late Chairman.

After his meeting with regional executives, Nana Akufo-Addo visited all the four pavilions of the main youth groups in Bolgatanga, namely, Holland Base, Atlantic Base, Zongo Youth Association and Dazoota Youth, with the same peace and reconciliation message.

By unanimous acclaim, in the four separate meetings held by Nana Akufo-Addo with the youth groups, they all agreed to work with the regional executives and help them prosecute a successful campaign in honour of their hero, Chairman Adams.

All in all it was a wonderful act of leadership by Akufo-Addo in reconciling a very pained and angered region.

The party in the region was most grateful to its presidential candidate, Nana Akufo-Addo, and pledged to deepen the process of peace and reconciliation to continue with the work of winning 2016.",2015-06-09T22:32:24+0000,link,http://thestatesmanonline.com/index.php/politics/1176-akufo-addo-reconciles-upper-east-npp,NA,1430,94,60,1584

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Akufo-Addo Sets Up GH¢100,000 Fund for Family of Late Adams Mahama

The 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has announced the setting up of a fund, with an initial capital of GH¢100,000, for the upkeep of the family of the late Adams Mahama, the  former NPP Upper East Chairman.

Nana Akufo-Addo made this known when he paid tribute to the late NPP Chairman at the Adua held at Jubilee Park in Bolgatanga on Sunday, June 7, 2015.
 
According to the NPP flagbearer, ""in addition to the amount of GH¢43,000 that has been donated by the party to the family and widow, and the GH¢90,000 that the Regional Chairmen have setup as a foundation for them, it is my responsibility to ensure that the party fund, as already promised, is established to take care of the education of the children and the maintenance of the widow. The initial capital is GH¢100,000. Additional contributions from sympathisers and well-wishers are, of course, welcome.""
 
Ever since the death of Adams Mahama, there have been uncountable testimonies about his generosity and how he went out of his way to care for the poor, the needy, the infirm and the old and destitute.
 
These deeds, Nana Akufo-Addo said, would surely grant him a place among the elect of God in Jannah.
 
""The Prophet Muhammad (Peace be unto him) is reported to have said that ‘the one who looks after a widow or a poor person is like a mujahid who fights for Allah’s cause or like him who performs prayers all night and fasts all the day’,"" Nana Addo noted.
 
He continued, ""We should therefore think of the admonition of Allah and accept that Adams is now resting at a better and hallowed place. It is about men like Adams that it is written: ‘Allah has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein; that is the supreme felicity’(Q: 9:89),"" he added.
 
Akufo-Addo urges self restraint
Though many party faithful have still not been able to come to terms with the tragic loss of Adams Mahama, Nana Akufo-Addo has urged members of the NPP to exercise self-restraint, adding that ""I plead with you that, in all we do, we treat the memory of Adams with dignity and reverence.""
 
He urged all NPP members to wait patiently for the police to do their work.
 
“So far, it appears they are doing a good job, and we expect them to continue to do so and not to be influenced in any way by political pressure of any sort. We take on board the reassurance given us by the Minister for the Interior that the President of the Republic continues to insist that justice will be done to Adams. But, I will state again what I said on May 29, 2015: we shall not be satisfied with anything less than the arrest and successful prosecution of the killers of Chairman Adams. There should be no ifs and buts,"" he said, to massive applause from the gathering.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo made a heartfelt appeal to the gathering, and to Ghanaians at large, to recognize and accept that violence cannot and should not be the manner of resolving political disputes in our country.
 
""What is more, my friends, the concept of an eye for an eye in dealing with wrongs, will leave all of us blind. Let us be consoled by the fact that Adams has found peace with Allah and let his legacy be one of peace in our community, in our party and in our country,"" he stressed.
 
Win election 2016 for Adams Mahama
Nana Akufo-Addo also urged the NPP to go all out and win the 2016 general elections and make sure that Adams Mahama did not die in vain.
 
He noted that Adams Mahama was convinced that the NPP will capture power in 2016 in order to improve the lives of the people of Ghana.
 
""The way in which we will not let his death be in vain is to rededicate ourselves to the struggle ahead, that is the struggle to redeem our country and return her to the path of progress and prosperity. When we have done this and put the smiles back on the faces of all the poor and needy people that Adams took care of, only then would we have truly “avenged” his death,"" he added.
 
Prayer for Accra flood victims
In concluding, Nana Akufo-Addo asked for prayers “for the victims of the horrendous tragedy that occurred in our capital city of Accra on the Ring Road Central last Wednesday.""
 
That day, Nana Akufo-Addo said ""was, indeed, a dark day in our nation’s history. We beg the Almighty to give their souls peaceful rest, and a speedy recovery to the injured.""

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"TRIBUTE BY NANA AKUFO-ADDO, 2016 NPP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, TO THE LATE ADAMS MAHAMA AT THE ADUA AT BOLGATANGA, ON SUNDAY, 7TH JUNE, 2015.

It is with a sad and heavy heart that I make this short speech at the funeral rites of Adams Mahama, as a tribute to our fallen colleague and as a petition to the Al-mighty Allah. May Allah accept our brother Adams into Jannah (paradise). Adams was a believer in the true sense in which Islam defines a believer, for, as the Qur’an states:  “believers are those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel tremor in their hearts…who establish regular prayers and spend freely out of the gifts that We have given them for the sustenance of others…they have grades of dignity with their lord and forgiveness and generous sustenance” (Q: 8:2-4). Ever since the death of our brother, there have been uncountable testimonies about his generosity and how he went out of his way to care for the poor, the needy, the infirm and the old and destitute.

His good deeds on earth would surely grant him a place among the elect of God in Jannah. The Prophet Muhammad (Peace be unto him) is reported to have said that ‘the one who looks after a widow or a poor person is like a mujahid who fights for Allah’s cause or like him who performs prayers all night and fasts all the day’ (Bukhari, Vol VII, p.202). We should therefore think of the admonition of Allah and accept that Adams is now resting at a better and hallowed place. It is about men like Adams that it is written: “Allah has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein; that is the supreme felicity” (Q: 9:89).

I know that many of us continue to have great difficulty coping with the raw pain and anger generated by the tragedy. Many of us cannot come to terms with the fact that the life of such a virile, dynamic and charismatic young man has been cut short. I understand this anger and I share the pain; but I urge self-restraint and I plead with you that, in all we do, we treat the memory of Adams with dignity and reverence. 

Let us wait patiently for the police to do their work. So far, it appears they are doing a good job, and we expect them to continue to do so and not to be influenced in any way by political pressure of any sort. We take on board the reassurance given us by the Minister for the Interior that the President of the Republic continues to insist that justice will be done to Adams. But, I will state again what I said on May 29, 2015: we shall not be satisfied with anything less than the arrest and successful prosecution of the killers of Chairman Adams. There should be no ifs and buts. 
I make a heartfelt appeal to all of us to recognize and accept that violence cannot and should not be the manner of resolving political disputes in our country. What is more, my friends, the concept of an eye for an eye in dealing with wrongs, will leave all of us blind. Let us be consoled by the fact that Adams has found peace with Allah and let his legacy be one of peace in our community, in our party and in our country.

Adams was passionate about Ghana. He was convinced that the NPP will capture power in 2016 in order to improve the lives of the people of Ghana. It is up to us to make sure that Adams did not die in vain. 

The way in which we will not let his death be in vain is to rededicate ourselves to the struggle ahead, that is the struggle to redeem our country and return her to the path of progress and prosperity. When we have done this and put the smiles back on the faces of all the poor and needy people that Adams took care of, only then would we have truly “avenged” his death.

To his widow, children and family, I pray that Allah Himself be your consoler. Allah will not take Adams from you and not give you another comforter in his place. Allah assures you, saying, “I have nothing to give but paradise as a reward to my believing slave, who, if I cause his relation to die, remains patient and hopes for Allah’s reward.” (Bukhari). In addition to the amount of GH¢43,000 that has been donated by the party to the family and widow, and the GH¢90,000 that the Regional Chairmen have setup as a foundation for them, it is my responsibility to ensure that the party fund, as already promised, is established to take care of the education of the children and the maintenance of the widow. The initial capital is GH¢100,000. Additional contributions from sympathisers and well-wishers are, of course, welcome.

I cannot conclude this brief speech at the Adua on the occasion of Adams Mahama’s infamous death, without also referring to and praying for the victims of the horrendous tragedy that occurred in our capital city of Accra on the Ring Road Central last Wednesday. That day was, indeed, a dark day in our nation’s history. We beg the Almighty to give the souls of the dead a peaceful rest, and a speedy recovery to the injured. 

Again, as at the burial, we want, Mr. Interior Minister, to express to you and through you to the NDC Government and the President of the Republic our sincere appreciation for your acts of continuing solidarity with us in our hour of sorrow. We extend the same appreciation to the other political parties who have come here to mourn with us. Ghanaian democracy is strengthened thereby.

Let us all remain patient and pray for Allah’s reward. 

May the soul of Adams Mahama and the souls of all the faithful departed rest in the bosom of the Lord until the last day of the Resurrection when we shall meet again. 

Amen.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO SYMPATHISES WITH ACCRA FLOOD VICTIMS
 
The 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Akufo-Addo, on Thursday, June 4, 2015, witnessed at first-hand the devastation caused to life and property by Wednesday night's torrential downpour which hit the capital city, Accra.
 
Describing the incident as a ""major tragedy for Accra"" and a ""very bad day"" for Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo visited the Goil Filling Station that was gutted by fire at the Kwame Nkrumah Circle during the rains, which left close to 200 people dead, and also visited affected residents in Odawna who have been displaced by the flood.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo, who was initially accompanied by the Member of Parliament for Ayawaso Central, Hon. Henry Quartey; Member of Parliament for Okaikoi South, Hon. Ahmed Arthur; National Youth Organiser, Sammy Awuku; Otiko Afisa Djaba, National Women’s Organiser; Greater Accra NPP Chairman, Ishmael Ashitey; Greater Accra NPP Secretary, Adjei Sowah; Greater Accra NPP Women’s Organiser, Joyce Zampare; former Mayor of Accra and Member of the NPP’s Council of Elders, Nii Adjiri Blankson, expressed his heartfelt condolences to all those impacted by the flood.
 
Addressing the media, Nana Akufo-Addo said “our first focus should be to come to the aid of those affected by the tragedy, and subsequently examine what needs to be done to ensure that such things do not happen ever again.”
 
He noted that “these are trying moments for the families affected and I urge them to remain strong and continue to renew their faith in the Almighty. I came here, on behalf of the NPP and on my own behalf, to extend our condolence and deepest sympathies to all who have been affected by this horrendous tragedy. It is a dark day in the history of our capital, and all of us should pull together.”
 
Nana Akufo-Addo maintained that after those who have been displaced and affected by the floods are attended to, “we will have to look into this situation which affects us every year. We have to find out if measures that were supposed to have been put in place to forestall this occurrence were or were not put in place. If not, we must make sure that they are put in place so that we don’t go through this again in future. We have to find a lasting solution to this problem of perennial flooding.”
 
He thanked the security agencies for the work they are doing in trying to ensure a quick return to normal life for the affected, “whilst at the same time providing assurance, safety and security for all of us in this city.”
 
Whilst touring a nearby house gutted by the fire at the filling station, Nana Akufo-Addo was joined by the General Secretary of the NPP, Kwabena Agyepong. Together with the entourage, they visited areas in Odawna and consoled those worst-hit by the floods.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Ladies and gentlemen, a week ago, there was a painful, horrendous and tragic death in the NPP family. The Chairman of our party in the Upper East region was murdered. The circumstances of the death of Chairman Adams Mahama have shaken our party and I daresay, our nation, to depths not normally reached in everyday discourse. I admit freely to having been shaken to my inner core, and, thus, cut short my trip to Europe and returned home the very next day. It is a tragedy that I pray the Almighty would give us strength to deal with and spare us from a repetition ever again. The Adua prayers for Chairman Adams are scheduled for June 7th in Bolgatanga, and, until then, we remain in a state of mourning for our fallen colleague.

Since the tragedy, there has been an outbreak of a cacophony of voices within our party. There have been many cries from the heart by party loyalists and supporters and a sense of despair, felt by many, has been demonstrated in various ways. The regional chairmen have led the cry and they have been followed by other important, identifiable groups and individuals within the party. It was to be expected that the regional chairmen should lead the cry; after all, Chairman Adams was one of them. It is especially sad for our party that this tragedy should befall us right at the time, indeed the first time, that we have a group of regional chairmen who have developed such a great sense of brotherliness among themselves. It is not surprising, therefore, that they should consider an attack on one of them as an attack on all of them. Hopefully, this act of infamy should bind them even tighter together.

As I have tried to deal with my own personal loss and heartbreak, I have been listening to many people and taking on board the controversies and sentiments that have been generated. It is my responsibility as flag bearer to listen and, then, seek to do what is in the best interest of our party. Having heard so many people, my first call on all party members and supporters is to cease fire. The finger pointing, the name calling, the insults, the lies, the denigrating of past and current leaders must stop. They are to be roundly condemned. His Excellency John Agyekum Kufuor, 2nd President of the Fourth Republic, remains an icon of our party and nation, whose legacy we in the NPP must jealously guard. There is absolutely nothing to be gained from internal recriminations within the NPP except to provide fertile soil for our opponents. 

It is unseemly and disrespectful towards the memory of Chairman Adams that such loud noises should continue within the party, whilst we are still in the official mourning period. A certain amount of outburst induced by the tragedy is understandable because of the extreme nature of the tragedy, but that should not mean that NPP members should behave out of character. 

Now that many sections of the party have spoken and made their appeals, the party structures should take over and deal with the issues that have been raised. Meetings of the National Executive Committee, the body charged with responsibility for directing the affairs of the party and, then, the National Council, the highest decision making body of the party, except for the National Annual Delegates’ Conference, should be convened after the Adua prayers to resolve the issues that we face. I am confident that these bodies will act in the collective interest of the party.

None of us in the NPP should forget for one moment that we have an election to fight and win in 18 months’ time and that we are in the middle of selecting our parliamentary candidates for that purpose; none of us should forget the desperate state into which our nation has been plunged; and none of us should forget that the people of Ghana look to us to rescue our nation. We dare not jeopardize this sacred trust by fruitless internal strife. Chairman Adams was a passionate party man, he wanted and fought to make possible an NPP victory in 2016. Let us win it in his memory.

But, perhaps, most important for us immediately is the need for the law enforcement agencies to bring a quick resolution to the despicable, criminal act that took place in Bolgatanga a week ago. We note the professionalism so far displayed by them in their investigations. We expect them to continue to do so and not to be influenced in any way by political pressure of any sort. I acknowledge and appreciate the sentiments expressed by the President of the Republic with the promise that justice will be done to Chairman Adams and we intend to hold him to that promise. It is unfortunate, but true, that criminal activities with political undertones in this country have tended not to be resolved satisfactorily. The latest example of this is the shooting and killing of the Nkwanta South DCE some six months ago. It does not engender public confidence that, up to today, there has been no word on the investigations into that crime. We shall not be satisfied with anything less than the arrest and successful prosecution of the killers of Chairman Adams. There should be no ifs and buts.

Whilst we continue with the period of mourning for Chairman Adams and until the party’s governing bodies meet, I ask that we normalize things within our party. This means, for instance, that the officers of the party, the National Chairman and the General Secretary in particular, must have access to their offices at party headquarters and not be hindered in any way from being able to conduct their duties. The NPP way of doing things is to be guided by law and order and I ask that normalcy return to our headquarters and party offices. I ask that we extend mutual respect to each other and we listen to each other.

I will not tolerate chaos within our party. The recriminations against ourselves in this period of healing, I repeat, must stop. On the contrary, we should all embrace the laudable initiative of the National Women’s Organiser who is launching, as from this Sunday here at the party headquarters, a week of fasting and prayers for the welfare of the NPP. I have no doubt that, with the help of Almighty God and by our collective determination, the storms that are currently buffeting the great, historic movement that the NPP represents will soon subside so that it can fulfil its mission of developing our nation in freedom. 

The NPP is not the first party to face crisis and the NPP will not be the last party to come out of its crisis stronger. I want to assure you. I am confident of our capacity to overcome and we shall overcome.  

Finally, I want to reassure all our members, supporters and the country at large that I remain focused on the main project of winning the election of 2016 and forming an NPP administration that will restore hope to our nation. We owe that to the long line of martyrs for freedom and justice in Ghana, and to the millions and millions of hardworking Ghanaians who have seen their efforts destroyed in a difficult, declining economy. This nation deserves a competent, compassionate and honest government and we in the NPP have to provide it so that Ghana can go back to a bright future of progress and prosperity. We have no choice. Come, then, patriots of the NPP, let us stand together, shoulder to shoulder, in the cause of the NPP and make it happen for mother Ghana.  

Let me end with a word from Holy Scripture and pardon me that I take the liberty of amending it slightly to make my point. Psalm 122, verses 6-8. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: Pray for the peace of the NPP, Pray for the peace of Ghana, May they prosper who love you.  Peace be within our walls, Peace be within our homes and offices. Prosperity within our country and our communities. For the sake of my brethren and companions, for the sake of my colleagues in the NPP and in our country, I will now say, Peace be within us.

God bless the NPP! God bless Ghana! God bless Africa!

Thank you.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"REJOINDER: REGIONAL CHAIRMEN PLAN TO OUST AFOKO, AGYEPONG
 
The attention of the Office of Nana Akufo-Addo has been drawn to a story on page 19 of the May 25, 2015 edition of the Daily Graphic titled “Regional Chairmen plan to oust Afoko, Agyepong?”
 
The story, written by Kobby Asmah and Abdul Aziz, claims that “the emergency regional congresses aimed at rallying support for the ousting of the two National Executive members, according to some close sources of the Party, were allegedly being instigated by the Party’s flagbearer, Nana Akufo-Addo.”
 
The story also goes on to quote the National Chairman of the NPP, Mr. Paul Afoko as confirming that he was informed of the Regional Executive Committee meetings by the flagbearer, and that he, Mr. Afoko, was at a loss as to why the Regional Executive Committee meetings should be allowed to take place on the same day as the scheduled NEC meeting.
 
The import of this Daily Graphic report seeks to portray Nana Akufo-Addo as having sanctioned the Regional Executive Committee meetings, despite an earlier agreement with the National Chairman to hold a National Executive Committee meeting on the same day, Monday, May 25, 2015.
 
This impression is totally wrong, flawed, and mischievous. As a general rule, Nana Akufo-Addo does not to like to engage in media commentary on internal NPP matters, but, having regard to the importance of the issues at stake and the central role of the Daily Graphic in the Ghanaian media, it is necessary for him to set the records straight.
 
The facts of the matter are as follows:
 
1.       On his arrival from Europe on May 22, he met in the evening with the Chairman and General Secretary of the party to review the recent, unfortunate, tragic developments that had taken place in the party. They agreed that a joint meeting of the National Executive Committee and the National Council of Elders be convened for Monday, May 25, to deliberate on them.
 
2.       The next day, May 23, at the funeral in Bolgatanga of the late Adams Mahama, he took the opportunity to inform the Regional Chairmen and others about the impending National Executive Committee meeting scheduled for Monday, May 25th. He was then informed by the Regional Chairmen that they had already scheduled a meeting of their respective Regional Executive Committees for the same Monday, May 25th, and that they therefore were requesting that on his return to Accra, he should inform the National Chairman of this and seek an adjournment of the National Executive Committee meeting.
 
3.       On his return to Accra, on Saturday, May 23, he informed the National Chairman of this development, and urged the National Chairman and the General Secretary to make contact with the Regional Chairmen to sort the matter out so that the National Executive Committee meeting could take place as scheduled.
 
4.       To his surprise, on Sunday May 24, he received notice that the National Chairman had cancelled the National Executive Committee meeting scheduled for Monday, May 25, without any prior reference to him.
 
These are the facts of the matter and it is thus clear that Nana Akufo-Addo bore no responsibility whatsoever for the convening of the Regional Executive Committee meetings. Nana Akufo-Addo wants the membership of the NPP to understand that he continues to work for understanding and unity in the party.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO MEETS GERMAN CHANCELLOR, DR. ANGELA MERKEL
 
The 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on Tuesday, May 19, 2015, met briefly with German Chancellor, Dr Angela Merkel at the Deutscher Bundestag (the German Parliament), in Berlin, the capital of Germany. 
 
The brief discussion between the two leaders took place prior to the holding of a meeting of the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), at the Bundestag.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo, who is currently on the 4th day of his working visit to Germany, used the opportunity to renew acquaintances and also congratulate the German Chancellor on her re-election in September 2013, marking her 3rd term in office as the leader of Europe's biggest economic power. On her part, Dr. Merkel, who is also the leader of the CDU, thanked Nana Akufo-Addo for his visit and wished the NPP leader well ahead of the December 2016 election.
 
Prior to the meeting with the German Chancellor, Nana Akufo-Addo met with Mr. Volkmar Klein MdB, budgetary and financial policy spokesman of the CDU parliamentary group at the Bundestag.
 
He also called on Ambassador Georg Schmidt, Regional Director for sub-Saharan Africa and the Sahel of the Federal Foreign Office, in his final meeting of the day.
 
Issues bordering on the state of the Ghanaian economy, the consolidation of the democratic credentials of Ghana, as well as the importance of regional integration as a tool for the rapid development of the West African region, were discussed.
 
On the consolidation of Ghana’s democracy, Nana Akufo-Addo stressed the need for the compilation of a new voter’s register, as a credible voter’s register is of the utmost importance ahead of the 2016 election.
 
“We are not interested in playing the blame game. We are only interested in doing what is right for our democracy. The Ghanaian election should not be a West African election. We want the Electoral Commission to listen to the growing calls for a credible register and do what is required after to achieve that,” he said.  
 
On regional integration, Nana Akufo-Addo stated that Ghana, Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal can do for the West African region what Germany, France and the Benelux countries did for Europe, by leading the push for economic integration.
 
He stressed that without regional integration, West Africa’s small economies, other than Nigeria’s, will struggle for relevance, “denying ourselves the capacity to compete in this increasingly competitive global environment.”    

Nana Akufo-Addo also participated in the celebration, on 19th May, 2015, of Africa Day in Berlin, where the keynote speaker was the former Nigerian President, H.E. Olusegun Obasanjo. He exchanged warm greetings there with Ghana’s Ambassador to Germany, Ms. Akua Sena Dansoa, both of whom had been Members of Parliament at the same time.
 
On Monday, May 18, 2015, Nana Akufo-Addo, under the auspices of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), met with Mr. Klaus Schuler, who is the Federal Manager of the CDU and who has also doubled as the campaign manager for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 3 successive electoral victories. At this meeting were Mr. Frank Priess, Deputy Head of European and International Co-operation of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, and Mme. Andrea Ostheimer, head of the department for sub-Saharan Africa at KAS.  
 
Early that same day, Nana Akufo-Addo paid a courtesy call on Mr. Hartwig Fischer, the President of Deutscher Afrika Stiftung (German African Foundation).

On Wednesday, prior to his departure for Amsterdam, Nana Akufo-Addo met with Mr. Charles Huber MdB, the well-known actor of Senegalese descent, who is a CDU Member of the Bundestag.

According to the MP, a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs at the Bundestag, Africa needs a change of perspective and should not be overly dependent on aid from developed countries. He stressed that the time is right for African economies to depart from being mere exporters of raw materials, and embrace ""value added policies."" The development of a genuine regional market, through regional integration, he added, is one of the surest ways to bring about sustained prosperity in the region. 

Nana Akufo-Addo, who has over the years been an ardent advocate of the policies being espoused by the German MP, maintained that when given the opportunity, with God’s blessing, by the Ghanaian electorate in 2016, he will seek to improve the living standards of the citizenry through the implementation of such policies.

“I have always been a firm believer that raw material producing economies do not create prosperity for the masses. The way to that goal, the goal of ensuring access to prosperity, is value addition activities in a transformed and a diversified modern economy,” he argued.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo was accompanied to these meetings by Ms. Otiko Afisa Djaba, the National Women’s Organiser of the NPP; Mr. Charles Owiredu, Director of International Relations of the NPP; Rev. Alex Acheampong, Chairman of the NPP branch in Germany; Mr. Sammy Adjei, 1st Vice Chairman of NPP Germany; Mrs. Rebecca Sarpong, 2nd Vice Chairperson of NPP Germany; Mr. Francis Asenso-Boakye, Political Assistant to Nana Akufo-Addo; and Mr. Eugene Arhin, Press Secretary to Nana Akufo-Addo.
 
The NPP presidential candidate on Wednesday, May 20, 2015, left for the Netherlands, the second country of his 16-day tour of Europe.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""If the automatic adjustment pricing formula says nothing can be done about the increases in the prices of petroleum products, even though when the world market price of crude oil went down, the equivalent reduction in petroleum prices did not take place, government can, at least, ease the suffering of Ghanaians and business by reducing significantly, or at best abolishing, the taxes on diesel and petroleum products. That will be a sign of a sensitive government."" - Nana Akufo-Addo (Berlin, 18/5/15)",2015-05-18T14:26:46+0000,status,NA,NA,1233,136,40,1409
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"FUEL PRICE INCREASES AND DUMSOR MARKS OF MAHAMA’S INSENSITIVITY

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has described the decision by the John Mahama-led National Democratic Congress government to increase the prices of petroleum products, in the midst of the ongoing, crippling energy crisis, as marks of an insensitive government.

According to him, at a time when Ghanaians are reeling from the effects of 3 years of ‘dumsor’ and resorting to the use of generators to produce power, a responsible government would rather ensure that the fuel which aids citizens and businesses to generate power would not receive an upward adjustment in its price.

However, as has been the mark of the flailing 6-year NDC administration, this latest development, according to the NPP’s 2016 presidential candidate, “means there is no end to the difficulties for the ordinary Ghanaian.”

Nana Akufo-Addo made this known on Saturday, May 16, 2015, when he addressed a packed meeting of Ghanaians, NPP members and sympathisers in Köln, Germany, on the first day of his 16-day tour of some European countries.

Ghanaians, Akufo-Addo said, have had the opportunity to witness at first hand the governance and leadership styles of the NPP and NDC, and its resultant impact on their standard of living.

“When President Kufuor left office, people were speaking of our country as Africa’s success story, possessing a stable democracy and an economy on the rise. Within six years of his leaving office, Ghana has retrogressed. Ghanaians are suffering and experiencing difficulties never witnessed in our history,” Nana Addo said.

He stated that no single government in Ghana’s history has had the resources and monies that the Mahama administration has been blessed with.

Between 2001 and 2008, the total tax revenue collected by the NPP amounted to GH¢15.2 billion. In contrast, the NDC government, under John Mahama, has collected a total of GH¢62 billion in the last six years (2009-2014). Exports of gold and cocoa between 2001 and 2008 earned Ghana $16.4 billion. However under six years of NDC, these exports have earned the country $39.5 billion, in addition to the $3 billion in oil revenues and the GH¢78.7 billion worth of new loans contracted by the NDC government. Kufuor’s government received no oil revenues.

“But today, Ghana is broke and back to the IMF looking for a bailout of $1 billion. Ghanaians want change, they want to go back to the Kufuor era of progress and development. Despite all the difficulties they are facing, they have hope in the NPP,” Nana Addo said.

In recent times, however, this hope in the NPP, Nana Addo said, may somewhat have been questioned because of the internal wranglings in the NPP, which have become a source of worry to Ghanaians.

“However, I want to assure all of you, and Ghanaians back home, that all these internal wranglings will soon come to an end. We will elect our parliamentary candidates on June 13, and thereafter we will announce our campaign team. We will then have one objective after that, which is to win the election of 2016,” he said, to spontaneous applause and cheers from the gathering.  

Nana Akufo-Addo urged Ghanaians to continue to have faith in the NPP, adding that Ghana’s predicament can be turned around, citing the case of Cote d’Ivoire – a country that was ravaged by civil war and yet has managed to turn its fortunes around.

“Because they got a strong and competent leader, they have turned everything around, and today Cote d’Ivoire is rediscovering itself. It is again the engine of growth of Francophone West Africa, because they have found a competent, strong leader,” he said.

He continued, “If a man, Alassane Ouatarra, who is three whole years older than me, has been able to change the destiny of Cote d’Ivoire, all I am asking God and Ghanaians is to give me that same opportunity to bring back our country onto the path of progress and prosperity.”

Nana Akufo-Addo asked for the full support of the membership of the NPP towards ensuring victory in the election of 2016, and by that “build the free, democratic and prosperous Ghana that our founding fathers dreamed about. That dream is very much alive in me. I have the hope and confidence that we can be the beacon and the Black Star of Africa.”

The NPP Presidential Candidate will move to Berlin on Monday, where he will participate in a series of events organised in his honour by the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, the development foundation associated with the German governing CDU party, a sister party of the NPP.",2015-05-17T12:47:28+0000,status,NA,NA,1999,400,215,2614

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"GHANA FOREVER INDEBTED TO THEODOSIA OKOH, SAYS NANA AKUFO-ADDO

The 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says Ghana’s history, when written, will not be complete without the inclusion of the immense contributions made by the late Mrs. Theodosia Okoh.

According to Nana Akufo-Addo, Mrs. Okoh’s contributions to the development of sports in Ghana, especially the game of hockey, in addition to the fact that she designed the flag of Ghana will forever be remembered by the people of Ghana. 

Nana Akufo-Addo made this known when he called on the family of Mrs. Okoh, on Thursday, May 14, 2015, to express his deepest condolences on her passing.

The NPP presidential candidate explained to the family that “my schedules haven't allowed me to be here at the time I was supposed to have come to mourn with you. Forgive me for that.""

""The contributions made by our mother to the development of our country have been immense. She belongs to the independence generation, those involved in the struggle for Ghana’s freedom. Her husband, the late Enoch Okoh, was a senior civil servant during the era of the first leader of our country, Kwame Nkrumah. Indeed, I know members of this family well, including her son, Mr. Kwame Okoh, whom I have worked with before,” Akufo-Addo said. 

Nana Akufo-Addo assured the family that though he will not be able to make it to the funeral, which is scheduled to take place on May 28th, 2015, he will make sure that he is adequately represented at the ceremony. 

Mr. Kwasi Okoh, eldest son of Mrs Okoh, thanked Nana Akufo-Addo for his visit, adding that “you have honoured us by your presence here. Our mother will certainly be very happy with your presence in her house.” 

Nana Akufo-Addo also signed a book of condolences opened in honour of Mrs. Okoh.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO CONGRATULATES DAVID CAMERON ON HIS RE-ELECTION
 
This is to congratulate warmly British Prime Minister, David Cameron, and the Conservative Party for their victory in Thursday’s general elections, which saw David Cameron re-elected with a stronger mandate as Prime Minister, with the Conservative Party securing an overall majority with 331 out of the 650 seats in the House of Commons.
 
The outcome of the elections is a clear vote of confidence in the sterling leadership provided by David Cameron and the Conservative Party, who, over the last five years, have offered decisive leadership to put Britain back on the right track. By this historic victory, he has defied those who said that there would be a ‘hung’ Parliament, and that the difficult but necessary choices made by Mr Cameron and his government did not resonate with the concerns and aspirations of the British masses.
 
Upon assuming office in 2010, David Cameron met an economy caught in the global financial crisis, a growing public debt, and rising unemployment. He came in with a plan, set the right priorities, stayed focused and has delivered on where it matters most – the economy. The results in Thursday's polls show that the British people believe that their Government, under David Cameron’s leadership, has restored confidence and is delivering on the economy, on jobs, and on improved living standards which are providing families with a growing sense of security.
 
For us in the New Patriotic Party, we are excited by the victory of the Conservative Party because the values we both share – beliefs in individual liberty, freedom and responsibility, respect for human rights and the rule of law, the principles of democratic accountability, the efficacy of the market economy and social justice – have proven again to be the surest way towards steering any nation back onto the path of strong economic growth and prosperity.
 
Warm congratulations once again to David Cameron, and best wishes for his continued success, especially, his pledge to lead a government for “one nation” and make “Great Britain greater.”

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"The attention of the Office of Nana Akufo-Addo has been drawn to a completely false publication being circulated in the social media by obvious, crude propagandists of the ruling party in Ghana, titled “GHANA – COTE D’IVOIRE MARITIME BOUNDARY DISPUTE… GHANA OPPOSITION LEADER UPHOLDS COTE D’IVOIRE’S CASE”.

The poorly written article, with bad grammar and spelling mistakes, is said to have been published allegedly by one Alistair Beaumont of the so-called Africa Confidential International. It impugned the integrity of both the President of Cote d’Ivoire and the Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party.

It sought to create the impression that President Alassane Ouattara and Nana Akufo-Addo have conspired together for the latter to give away Ghana’s interest in the disputed maritime boundary in return for material support by the Ivorian leader to the NPP’s campaign. It quotes from a fictitious letter from the NPP leader to the Ivorian leader promising to cede Ghana’s interest in the disputed maritime boundary to the neighbouring country if elected to office in 2017. This is, of course, totally false and can never be true as it is a complete fabrication. It is a very puerile attempt to defame the two political leaders and we leave it to the good judgment of the public to ask themselves which group would find such an unfortunate propaganda useful for their political purposes.

Our checks show that Africa Confidential International does not exist. This Office is prepared to wager that, in the same vein, “Alistair Beaumont” does not exist. The attempt by those behind this fabricated story against Nana Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party and the President of Cote d’Ivoire to deceive the public that the publication is from the reputable Africa Confidential was exposed by their own doubtful knowledge. 
1. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo’s name was spelt wrongly as Nana Addo Dankwah [sic] Akufo-Addo. 
2. President Alasane Ouatarra’s name was also spelt wrongly as Allasane [sic] Ouatara [sic]. 

Nana Akufo-Addo is a respected Ghanaian patriot, who has given the better part of his adult life to the struggle to improve the lot of Ghana and the ordinary Ghanaian, and would never barter away Ghana’s interests for his personal gain.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO'S MAY DAY MESSAGE
 
On this day set aside to celebrate workers worldwide, I salute all Ghanaian workers, both in the formal and informal sectors, for their enduring hard work and patriotic contribution towards Ghana’s development over the years.
 
This year’s celebration comes at a time when the current state of our country, under this NDC government, is in disarray. Today, our economy is in serious decline, evident in the $912 million IMF bailout package, which, as a result of government indiscipline, comes at a high cost to the Ghanaian people, including anticipated job cuts; widespread and rampant corruption which is robbing our nation of scarce resources; indecisive leadership; as well as the crippling effects of “dumsor dumsor”, which continues to cost the nation billions of Ghana cedis.
 
Ghanaians, and most especially workers, are bearing the full brunt of the mismanagement of the Ghanaian economy. Workers’ wages are only to see a 13% increase for the three-year period of the IMF bailout. This would, no doubt, make the Ghanaian worker poorer and poorer, as the cost of living gets ever higher than his or her take-home pay. Prior to this development, government, beginning this year, scrapped the 10% Cost of Living Allowance, despite the rising cost of living. Industries and small businesses are folding up because of “dumsor dumsor”, which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs. The Ghanaian worker is suffering. They deserve better and the President must set his priorities right and respond to their concerns with deeds and not words.
 
Despite all these difficulties, my message to the anxious Ghanaian workforce is this: stay faithful to the Ghanaian enterprise. A bright future awaits you. The NPP has shown, from 2001 to 2009, that we have the blueprint to ensuring greater employment and rapid economic growth. We have shown through our policies that we are far better in responding to the welfare of the masses. Under the NPP, Ghana saw a significant, unprecedented expansion of the national economy, which led to higher real wages and more jobs.
 
We remain committed to the enhancement of the dignity of the Ghanaian labour force. The structural transformation of the Ghanaian economy, with the goal of industrialising and adding value to our primary products, and an uncompromising adherence to value for money in the use of the public purse will be the means by which we will expand economic activity and public infrastructure to create the necessary numbers of high-paying jobs that will enhance the living standards of the mass of our people. The NPP is resolute in its commitment to building a society of opportunities for the Ghanaian people, which will provide good education, good skills, good jobs and good pay for all its citizens.
 
Together, we can build a nation that we can leave to our children and their children with pride and dignity. The wellbeing of the Ghanaian workforce and the future of their children are our priorities.
 
God bless the workers of Ghana! God bless Ghana!

The 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has charged President Mahama to cut the lip-service, set his priorities right and respond to the growing concerns of Ghanaian workers.  
 
In his May Day message, Nana Akufo-Addo lamented about the numerous problems confronting the Ghanaian worker, occasioned by the mismanagement of the economy and the fiscal indiscipline that has characterised the rule of the NDC government over the last 6 years, adding that workers “deserve better and the President must set his priorities right and respond to their concerns with deeds and not words.”
 
According to him, this year’s May Day celebrations come at a time “when the current state of our country, under this NDC government, is in disarray”, as Ghanaians, and most especially workers are bearing the full brunt of the economic mismanagement.
 
An economy in serious decline, evident in the $912 million IMF bailout package with its anticipated job cuts, widespread and rampant corruption, indecisive leadership, as well as the crippling effects of “dumsor dumsor”, which continues to cost the nation billions of Ghana cedis, Akufo-Addo said, are examples of the serious problems facing the nation.
 
As a result of these problems, he noted that “workers’ wages are only to see a 13% increase for the three-year period of the IMF bailout. This would, no doubt, make the Ghanaian worker poorer and poorer, as the cost of living gets ever higher than his or her take-home pay. Prior to this development, government, beginning this year, scrapped the 10% Cost of Living Allowance, despite the rising cost of living. Industries and small businesses are folding up because of ‘dumsor dumsor’, which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs.”
 
“The Ghanaian worker is suffering,” Akufo-Addo said
 
Inspite of these difficulties, Nana Akufo-Addo urged the “anxious Ghanaian workforce” not to lose hope.
 
“Stay faithful to the Ghanaian enterprise. A bright future awaits you. The NPP has shown, from 2001 to 2009, that we have the blueprint to ensuring greater employment and rapid economic growth. We have shown through our policies that we are far better in responding to the welfare of the masses. Under the NPP, Ghana saw a significant, unprecedented expansion of the national economy, which led to higher real wages and more jobs,” he said.
 
He continued, “We remain committed to the enhancement of the dignity of the Ghanaian labour force. The structural transformation of the Ghanaian economy, with the goal of industrialising and adding value to our primary products, and an uncompromising adherence to value for money in the use of the public purse will be the means by which we will expand economic activity and public infrastructure to create the necessary numbers of high-paying jobs that will enhance the living standards of the mass of our people.”
 
Nana Akufo-Addo reassured Ghanaian workers about the commitment of the NPP to building a society of opportunities for the Ghanaian people, which will provide good education, good skills, good jobs and good pay for all its citizens.
 
“Together, we can build a nation that we can leave to our children and their children with pride and dignity. The wellbeing of the Ghanaian workforce and the future of their children are our priorities,” he concluded.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"MONIES FROM SADA, GYEEDA, JUDGEMENT DEBTS GREATER THAN IMF BAILOUT, AKUFO-ADDO REVEALS

The 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has revealed that monies from only three scams that have rocked the nation under the era of the National Democratic Congress government are greater than the entire bailout Ghana is receiving from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

According to Nana Akufo-Addo, who was addressing a packed hall of students of the University of Cape Coast on Saturday, April 18, 2015, corruption on any scale is expensive, adding that it “has been especially expensive to Ghana’s development under this fourth NDC government.”

Stating facts to buttress his assertions, Nana Addo revealed that the cost of scams involving SADA (GH¢200 million), GYEEDA (GH¢952 million) and the payment of questionable judgement debts (GH¢657 million) amount to a whopping GH¢1.8 billion. 

“At the exchange rate that was prevailing at the time when the scams took place, we are talking about $1.1 billion. The entire IMF bailout is $912 million,” Nana Addo said to a massive roar of disbelief from the students.

Continuing, he said “These scams, that I have mentioned, are only a fraction of the numerous scams that you and I know about. Just these three give a loss to our nation which is more than the entire (IMF) bailout.”

Nana Akufo-Addo explained that “unless we tackle the problem of corruption in government, we run a real risk of cynicism overcoming our politics and, thus, a catastrophic loss of confidence in our democracy. Ghana cannot afford this, our forebears did not struggle for Ghana to end up in such a sad state of affairs, and I believe that we can, in this generation, deliver the economic transformation that has eluded us so far if we do the right thing.” 
The NPP, he said, understands that Ghanaians are weary of the impact of pervasive corruption on our society and simply want their government to fix the problem. 

“They want it fixed not with words, but action. It is my belief that the fight against corruption must start with an incorruptible President. I have said so before and I will repeat it again today. I can assure you, in all humility, that I am not, have never been and will never be corrupt.” 

“I can also assure you that, as your President, I will NOT condone corruption in my Government,” Nana Addo added.
He reinforced statements he has already made in the past by stating that “people who see service in government as an avenue for making money will have no place in my government. Their proper place is in the private sector, where money-making is a positive thing. Public service is exactly that, public service.”

In concluding, Nana Akufo-Addo assured the gathering that “I bring to the table and to the Office of President of this potentially great country an unblemished track record of personal integrity and fortitude. I invite you to bank on my essential leadership attributes and help make me your president. I will lead a strong fight against corruption in this country.”",2015-04-19T12:38:43+0000,status,NA,NA,1494,232,97,1823
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"“DUMSOR BORDERS ON GHANA’S SURVIVAL” – NANA AKUFO-ADDO

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo says the devastation that “dumsor dusmsor” is wrecking on Ghana goes beyond opposition or government talk, as the cost of the erratic nature of power supply borders on the very survival of the citizenry and businesses in the country.

The 2016 Presidential Candidate of the NPP wondered why “government apologists are saying that after the government resolves the “dumsor” crisis we, as opposition people, will have nothing to talk about.”

“I am astonished by this proposition,” Nana Addo saidd, adding that dumsor “is not a campaign weapon. It borders on the very survival of our country.”

Addressing students of the University of Cape Coast over the weekend, Nana Addo stated that the estimates made by the highly respected Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER), put the cost of “dumsor” for 2014 alone in excess of 1 billion Ghana Cedis. 

Nana Akufo-Addo reiterated that if the nation considers the fact that ‘dumsor dumsor’ has been going on since 2012, “then we are talking about a national loss of some 4 billion Cedis.”  

He noted that “today, industries are folding up, workers are being retrenched, livelihoods are being lost, people are dying needlessly in our hospitals, our economy is in serious decline, all of which add up to the ravages of poverty and disease. These are not matters about which a nation can recover with the wave of a hand or with the resolution of the crisis of ‘dumsor’”. 

“How does the resolution of the crisis of “dumsor” resurrect the many Ghanaians who have lost their lives in hospitals across the country? How does the resolution of the crisis of “dumsor” restore the livelihoods of the thousands of workers who have lost their jobs? How does the resolution of the crisis of “dumsor” restore the loss of productivity over the past three years?” Nana Addo asked. 

He continued, “I know of a group of investors who have their factories around the Achimota Brewery, and who manufacture plastic products. They have closed shop and are leaving for Ethiopia. There are many, many such stories. Today, investor confidence in our country is at an all- time low. The 4 billion Ghana Cedis that this nation has lost to the crisis of “dumsor” can per the calculation of this government build about 60 senior high schools.” 

The NPP flagbearer also recounted the suggestion made by the Director General of Ghana Health Services, Dr. Ebenezer Appiah-Denkyira, to health facilities to charge patients an extra amount of money to take care of the cost of “dumsor.” 

“Already the health insurance scheme which the NPP government under President Kufuor introduced has collapsed and to think that we will have to pay extra to take care of “dumsor” is unimaginable,” he added. 

Nana Addo made these remarks when he addressed students of the University of Cape Coast over the weekend.",2015-04-19T12:37:13+0000,status,NA,NA,789,56,27,872
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"DEFICIT OF IDEAS, ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT LED GHANA TO IMF, SAYS AKUFO-ADDO

The 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo says the decision by the Mahama-led National Democratic Congress government to go for a bailout from the IMF “is as a result of the deficit of ideas in solving problems like dumsor, coupled with the mismanagement of the economy and a lack of fiscal discipline.”

Delivering a brief address to a packed hall of students of the University of Cape Coast, at a meeting of the Tertiary Students Confederacy (TESCON), on Saturday, April 18, 2015, Nana Addo stated that the whole world is at a loss as to how “for the first time in history, an oil rich country, some five years into oil production, is seeking a bailout from the IMF.” 

According to the NPP flagbearer, this NDC government has received more money in loans, tax revenues and export receipts than any other government in our history, but has surprisingly ended up with Ghana going cap-in-hand to the IMF for assistance. 
“This sad spectacle is an indictment on the kind of leadership we have at the helm of affairs in our country,” he emphasized. 

He recounted how the NPP, under the leadership of President Kufuor, showed in 8 years that fiscal discipline was possible, and this resulted in the NPP government committing the nation’s resources into areas that improved the lives of Ghanaians. 

“We need to bring back confidence in the economy so that businesses and families can plan their budgets properly. What an Akufo-Addo government will do again is to bring back that confidence,” he said, to a rousing applause from the audience. 

An Akufo-Addo government in 2017, God-willing and the people of Ghana consenting, he said, will ensure fiscal discipline on how taxpayers’ monies are spent and ensure macroeconomic stability. 
“Investors, domestic and foreign, will only be interested in Ghana when they can be assured of the bankability of investing in our economy,” he said. 

He continued, “We will move away from high budget deficits and reckless borrowing because we know of the benefits of fiscal responsibility – low inflation, reduced interest rates, exchange rate stability, avoiding HIPC and making savings for social and capital expenditure.”",2015-04-19T12:35:20+0000,status,NA,NA,933,77,47,1057
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Allow Council of State to do its work, Akufo-Addo urges Mahama

“I would respectfully urge the President to abide by the Constitution and allow the Council of State do its work openly and transparently, so that the final product will engender broad public confidence. It is important for the strengthening of our democracy. This is, in effect, the first time such an appointment is being made under the Fourth Republican Constitution – hence the anxiety of the public that we should get it right. I have no doubt that the President, the avowed democrat that he is, will not fail the people of Ghana in this regard.”
These were the words of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, when he addressed a packed hall of students at the University of Cape Coast, in a meeting of the Tertiary Students Confederacy (TESCON), on Saturday, April 18, 2015.

Contributing to the ongoing debate about who replaces the soon-to-retire Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan, Nana Akufo-Addo explained that the Fourth Republican Constitution makes it explicitly and unambiguously clear about who has the responsibility to appoint the Chairman of the EC.
In an apparent response to some who say President Mahama must be left alone to select the new EC boss, Nana Akufo-Addo’s message to them was simple.

“All citizens of Ghana have a stake in the appointment. Hence, the importance of public opinion in the process. The framers of the Constitution were keenly aware of the impropriety inherent in allowing the President, a political player, to play a critical role in selecting the political referee. Hence the constitutional arrangements of Article 70(2) of our Constitution,” he said.  
Article 70(2) provides that, “The President shall, acting on the advice of the Council of State, appoint the Chairman, Deputy Chairmen, and other members of the Electoral Commission.” 
This constitutional provision, according to Nana Akufo-Addo, imposes an obligation on the President to act on the advice of the Council of State in appointing the Chairman and Members of the EC.  

“Advice in this context refers to a binding instruction given by one constitutional officer to another. Thus, when Article 70(2) provides that the President shall act on the advice of the Council of State, it contemplates that the Council of State will put in place a mechanism to search for, vet and nominate a candidate for the President to appoint,” Nana Addo explained. 

He continued, “In many, many other jurisdictions across the world, whoever successfully emerges as head of the Electoral Commission is put through a rigorous selection procedure, which includes wide stakeholder consultation, vetting by a committee, often in public, and finally, approval by a special majority (<U+2154> or ¾) of the legislature. Appointment by the President is then a formality.”
On who should replace his “three year Legon Hall roommate, Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan”, Nana Addo outlined the qualities the eventual choice of the Council of State must possess. 

“He/She must be an efficient person, with an independent, impartial spirit, who generates confidence across the wider reaches of the society, and who owes his/her duty not to the government of the day, but to the people of Ghana,” The person, Nana Addo added, must restore the confidence of the people in the EC once again.

Ghana, according to the NPP flagbearer, cannot afford to get the choice of the new EC boss wrong, maintaining that “the surest way to safeguarding our democracy is ensuring that we have credible elections”, as the institution mandated by the 1992 Constitution to conduct and supervise public elections “must be seen by the citizenry and all stakeholders to be fair and ready to uphold the sovereign will of voters in their choice of their leaders.”
In recent years, a litany of events have dented the confidence of the public in the Electoral Commission.

These include the presidential election petition of 2013; the nullification by the Supreme Court of the use by the EC of NHIS cards as identification for voter registration; and the recent cancellation of the District Assembly and Unit Committee elections, on which $100 million of public money was spent.",2015-04-19T12:33:33+0000,status,NA,NA,879,101,43,1023
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"SPEECH BY NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO, 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY, AT THE MEETING OF TESCON, UCC ON SATURDAY 18TH APRIL 2015.

Mr. Chairman, Senior Members of the University of Cape Coast, Mahamudu Bawumia, Regional Secretary, Kwamina Duncan, NPP notables, Invited Guests, Students, I am excited at this opportunity to have a conversation with you, and thank you so much for this warm and tumultuous welcome. I am very, very grateful. Thank you very much indeed. I am excited, not just because you are as they say our future leaders, but because you remind me of the urgency of today, the urgency of now, the now of growing poverty, high cost of living, low income levels, massive unemployment, inadequate educational facilities, inadequate access to health and social services amongst others. The company of young people is doubly reassuring because the exuberance, dynamism and energy of young people is what we need for the quick push that we have to make if we are to catch up with the rest of the world. 

In all this, TESCON occupies a special place in the life of our nation, of our party and of myself. This is why I am so happy to speak again on a TESCON platform. 2000, the year of its inauguration, saw TESCON take the lead in mobilizing the youth of our party and of our country to make the historic change of 2000, when, for the first time in Ghanaian history, an opposition party, the NPP, came to power through the ballot box. That event gave a great boost to the consolidation of the principles of democratic accountability in our body politic. TESCON in 2000 acted under its wonderful slogan – commitment without inducement. Is that still your slogan? Are you sure? We need it to make history again, to make another crucial change. TESCON has been very generous to me. It has provided me with my Political Assistant, Francis Asenso-Boakye, its Founding President.

In 2000, I was the main speaker at an event in Independence Hall at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, when TESCON’s outreach programme was launched for the elections of that year. I made three commitments on that occasion. I said that if we won, we would repeal the infamous Criminal Libel Law; we would abolish the notorious cash and carry in our healthcare system; and we would in the next decade take Ghana from a poor to a middle income status. The NPP in power realised each one of these promises. We repealed the Criminal Libel Law. We abolished cash and carry and introduced the National Health Insurance Scheme. And by 2009, when we left office, Ghana was a middle income country.  

So I am here again so we can have a conversation, albeit brief. A conversation about our nation. A conversation about our collective future. A conversation about our democracy. You must show an interest in how this nation is run. It is important that you question the use to which the nation’s leaders are putting our money. It is important to question the use to which they are putting your parents’ tax money. Otherwise you run the risk of inheriting a nation that is bankrupt and incapable of meeting your aspirations: aspirations for which you have spent the better part of your life going to school.

Today the darkness that descends on you in the lecture halls in the middle of an exciting lecture is symptomatic of the darkness that has engulfed this nation. When I talk about the darkness that has engulfed this nation, I don’t just mean the literal sense in which we are constantly in the dark. But the sense of hopelessness and despair that has engulfed this nation. But let us not throw up our hands in despair. There is hope. There is light at the end of the tunnel. But we should not just depend on hope to bring this glorious future about. “Heaven helps those who help themselves.” You must show an interest and actively participate in the governance process of our country, if you are to have the Ghana of your aspirations. 

Mr. Chairman, Government apologists are saying that after the government resolves the “dumsor” crisis we, as opposition people, will have nothing to talk about. I am astonished by this proposition. The devastation that “dumsor” is wrecking on our nation goes beyond opposition or government talk. It is not a campaign weapon. It borders on the very survival of our country. According to the highly respected Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER), the cost of “dumsor” for 2014 alone is in excess of 1 billion Ghana cedis. If we consider that this crisis has been going on since 2012, then we are talking about a national loss of some 4 billion cedis.  Today, industries are folding up, workers are being retrenched, livelihoods are being lost, people are dying needlessly in our hospitals, our economy is in serious decline, all of which add up to the ravages of poverty and disease. These are not matters about which a nation can recover with the wave of a hand or with the resolution of the crisis of “dumsor.” How does the resolution of the crisis of “dumsor” resurrect the many Ghanaians who have lost their lives in hospitals across the country? How does the resolution of the crisis of “dumsor” restore the livelihoods of the thousands of workers who have lost their jobs? How does the resolution of the crisis of “dumsor” restore the loss of productivity over the past three years? I know of a group of investors who have their factories around the Achimota Brewery, and who manufacture plastic products. They have closed shop and are leaving for Ethiopia. There are many, many such stories. Today, investor confidence in our country is at an all- time low. The 4 billion Ghana cedis that this nation has lost to the crisis of “dumsor” can per the calculation of this government build about 60 senior high schools. Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a crisis. Just a few days ago, the Director General of Ghana Health Services, Dr. Ebenezer Appiah-Denkyira, suggested to health facilities to charge patients an extra amount of money to take care of the cost of “dumsor.” Already the health insurance scheme which the NPP government under President Kufuor introduced has collapsed and to think that we will have to pay extra to take care of “dumsor” is unimaginable. Barclays Bank is creating a new financial product that enables businesses to buy generators. And we are told that the resolution of the crisis at some uncertain date in the future will wipe out the effects of all this. 

It is as a result of the deficit of ideas in solving problems like dumsor, coupled with the mismanagement of the economy and a lack of fiscal discipline on the part of the Mahama-led NDC government that has led Ghana to the IMF. For the first time in history, an oil rich country, some five years into oil production, is seeking a bailout from the IMF. It is this government, which has received more money in loans, tax revenues and export receipts than any other government in our history, that has ended us up with our going cap-in-hand to the IMF for assistance. This sad spectacle is an indictment on the kind of leadership we have at the helm of affairs in our country. As our brilliant economist, my right hand man, Mahamudu Bawumia so aptly put it: “an IMF programme does not guarantee fiscal discipline. Only a commitment to fiscal discipline by the government can guarantee it.” The NPP, under the leadership of President John Agyekum Kufuor, showed in 8 years that fiscal discipline and committing the nation’s resources into areas that will improve the lives of Ghanaians are possible. We need to bring back confidence in the economy so that businesses and families can plan their budgets properly. What an Akufo-Addo government will do again is to bring back that confidence. We will ensure fiscal discipline on how taxpayers’ monies are spent and ensure macroeconomic stability. Investors, domestic and foreign, will only be interested in Ghana when they can be assured of the bankability of investing in our economy. We will move away from high budget deficits and reckless borrowing because we know of the benefits of fiscal responsibility – low inflation, reduced interest rates, exchange rate stability, avoiding HIPC and making savings for social and capital expenditure. With discipline and responsible management, we will have the money to restore teacher trainee and nurse trainee allowances.

Another debilitating factor in the management of our public finances so far under this government has been widespread corruption. It has become an even more dangerous factor now that we have oil. Unless we tackle the problem of corruption in government, we run a real risk of cynicism overcoming our politics and, thus, a catastrophic loss of confidence in our democracy. Ghana cannot afford this, our forebears did not struggle for Ghana to end up in such a sad state of affairs, and I believe that we can, in this generation, deliver the economic transformation that has eluded us so far if we do the right thing. Corruption has to be defeated. Corruption on any scale is expensive and has been especially expensive to Ghana’s development under this fourth NDC government. Let me give you a simple example to show you what I mean. The scams involving SADA, GH¢200 million; GYEEDA, GH¢952 million; and questionable judgement debts of GH¢687 million, all together, amount to GH¢1.8 billion. At the exchange rate that was prevailing at the time when the scams took place, we are talking about $1.1 billion. The entire IMF bailout is $912 million. These scams, that I have mentioned, are only a fraction of the numerous scams that you and I know about. Just these three give a loss to our nation which is more than the entire bailout. We, in the NPP, understand that the good people of Ghana are weary of the impact of pervasive corruption on our society and simply want their government to fix the problem. They want it fixed not with words, but action. It is my belief that the fight against corruption must start with an incorruptible President. I have said so before and I will repeat it again today. I can assure you, in all humility, that I am not, have never been and will never be corrupt. I can also assure you that, as your President, I will NOT condone corruption in my Government. I have stated publicly that people who see service in government as an avenue for making money will have no place in my government. Their proper place is in the private sector, where money-making is a positive thing. Public service is exactly that, public service. I bring to the table and to the Office of President of this potentially great country an unblemished track record of personal integrity and fortitude. I invite you to bank on my essential leadership attributes and help make me your president. I will lead a strong fight against corruption in this country.

In my interaction with people from all walks of life, during my time as Member of Parliament, Attorney General, Minister for Foreign Affairs and presidential candidate, one thing remains paramount – whether it is about cost of education, bad roads, high cost of living, low retail sales – Ghanaians need good jobs with good income. But the truth must be told. Unless we industrialise with the goal of adding significant value to our primary products, we cannot create the necessary numbers of high-paying jobs that will enhance the living standards of the mass of our people. Raw material producing economies do not create prosperity for the masses. The way to that goal, the goal of ensuring access to prosperity, is value addition activities in a transformed and a diversified modern economy. In other words, the industrial development of our economy. Voters agreeing and God willing, the next NPP government in 2017 will take office with a clear programme of action for the industrialisation of Ghana – an economic transformation that touches every region of Ghana. As the experiences of the successful countries in Asia and elsewhere have shown, Government has a very important and positive role to play in spurring industrialisation and economic transformation. Having learnt from our own early industrialisation attempt and the experiences of others, my government will actively promote Ghana’s industrialisation and economic transformation. The economic transformation programme is to put Ghana onto a clear path towards a high income economy and Ghanaians into high income earners. We can’t continue travelling the worn path of limited success of being exporters of raw materials. We have the entrepreneurs who can make it happen right here. 

One final matter. I have said before that “strong democracies are built by strengthening the institutions of democracy, rather than the power of men” and that “the gains we have made in our democracy due to the sacrifices of great individuals must be protected by great institutions.” The surest way to safeguarding our democracy is ensuring that we have credible elections. The institution mandated by the Constitution of the Fourth Republic to conduct and supervise public elections, the Electoral Commission, must be seen by the citizenry and all stakeholders to be fair and ready to uphold the sovereign will of voters in their choice of their leaders. A litany of recent events, i.e. the presidential election petition of 2013; the nullification by the Supreme Court of the use by the EC of NHIS cards as identification for voter registration; and the recent cancellation of the District Assembly and Unit Committee elections, on which $100 million of public money was spent, point to a Commission that has lost a great deal of the confidence of the people. Whoever, therefore, succeeds the soon-to-retire Chairman of the EC, my three year Legon Hall roommate, Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan, must once again restore confidence in this institution. He/she must be an efficient person, with an independent, impartial spirit, who generates confidence across the wider reaches of the society, and who owes his/her duty not to the government of the day, but to the people of Ghana. Some have stated that the President must be left alone to select the new EC boss. My message to them is simple: all citizens of Ghana have a stake in the appointment. Hence, the importance of public opinion in the process. The framers of the Constitution were keenly aware of the impropriety inherent in allowing the President, a political player, to play a critical role in selecting the political referee. Hence the constitutional arrangements of Article 70(2) of our Constitution.  

Article 70(2) provides that, “The President shall, acting on the advice of the Council of State, appoint the Chairman, Deputy Chairmen, and other members of the Electoral Commission.” This constitutional provision imposes an obligation on the President to act on the advice of the Council of State in appointing the Chairman and Members of the EC.  Advice in this context refers to a binding instruction given by one constitutional officer to another. Thus, when Article 70(2) provides that the President shall act on the advice of the Council of State, it contemplates that the Council of State will put in place a mechanism to search for, vet and nominate a candidate for the President to appoint. 

In many, many other jurisdictions across the world, whoever successfully emerges as head of the Electoral Commission is put through a rigorous selection procedure, which includes wide stakeholder consultation, vetting by a committee, often in public, and finally, approval by a special majority (<U+2154> or ¾) of the legislature. Appointment by the President is then a formality.
I would respectfully urge the President to abide by the Constitution and allow the Council of State do its work openly and transparently, so that the final product will engender broad public confidence. It is important for the strengthening of our democracy. This is, in effect, the first time such an appointment is being made under the Fourth Republican Constitution – hence the anxiety of the public that we should get it right. I have no doubt that the President, the avowed democrat that he is, will not fail the people of Ghana in this regard. 

In concluding, I want to urge all of you to believe in our capacity to achieve the greatness that others have achieved. We must believe in Ghana and do what is right by our nation, and thereby fulfil the dreams and aspirations of those far-sighted individuals, who assembled at Saltpond, not far from here, on that most seminal of days of 4th August 1947, to initiate the steps for our national freedom and independence. Their goal remains our goal – the creation of a free, democratic, prosperous nation governed under the rule of law, capable of making its own special contribution to the growth of world civilisation. With the guidance of the Almighty, we can make it. 

Thank you and may God bless Ghana, NPP and Africa.",2015-04-19T12:25:33+0000,status,NA,NA,1076,122,117,1315
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO CONDEMNS XENOPHOBIC ATTACKS IN SOUTH AFRICA
 
Over the past few days, I have learnt with utmost shock about the sickening and despicable acts of appalling brutality being perpetrated by local mobs in some parts of South Africa against immigrants, mainly black Africans and their businesses.
 
I condemn in the strongest terms these acts of persecution, which have so far, according to reports, claimed the lives of at least six people, including a 14-year old boy. There are also unconfirmed reports of a Ghanaian being among the dead. We expect Ghana's mission in South Africa to be a lot more helpful with the flow of information for Ghanaians worried about the fate of our compatriots in South Africa. 
 
I extend my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed in these unacceptable attacks. My thoughts and prayers are with the injured and the displaced.
 
I know at firsthand the extraordinary warmth and decency of the people of South Africa, the vast majority of whom are against acts that seek to violate the right to life of others. To this end, I respectfully urge President Jacob Zuma to do all in his power to ensure that these attacks end, as well as bring to book all persons responsible for this wave of violence.
 
President Mahama, through Ghana’s High Commission in South Africa, must come to the aid of all Ghanaians who are in need of help.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"“NDC’s 1 million votes in Ashanti will not happen” – Nana Akufo-Addo
 
The 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says the ruling National Democratic Congress’ mantra of “1 million votes in Ashanti” in the 2016 general elections will not materialise.

Describing it as nothing more than a mirage which will not see the light of day, Nana Akufo-Addo has assured NPP faithful that the Party’s leadership has targeted nothing less than 85% of the popular vote in the Ashanti region, reassuring them that “we will get it in 2016.”

Nana Akufo-Addo made this declaration when the Member of Parliament for the Subin Constituency in the Ashanti Region, together with constituency Chairman, Mr. Francis Boamah, and some 200 NPP women from the constituency, comprising polling station executives and other members, called on him at his Nima Residence on Wednesday, April 8, 2015.

Hon. Isaac Osei, who acted as spokesperson for the group, explained that the purpose of their presence in Accra was to visit Parliament and familiarise themselves with the operations of the Party at the national level, as well as reiterate their commitment to ensuring that the NPP, under the leadership of Akufo-Addo, wrestles political power from the NDC come 2016.  

He also indicated that, prior to their call on Nana Akufo-Addo, they had also called on the National Chairman, Mr. Paul Afoko, and other executives of the party at the National Headquarters at Kokomlemle.

Nana Akufo-Addo, whose wife, Rebecca Akufo-Addo, was also present, thanked the group for the visit. He noted that with women accounting for over 51% of Ghana’s population, they have a unique role in deciding the fate of the nation, with regards to who leads and returns her back onto the path of progress and prosperity.

“Ghana is retrogressing under the Mahama government. All the gains chalked by President Kufuor have been eroded within 6 years of the NDC government taking over the reins of office. We have a duty as members of the NPP to make sure Ghana works again, and we have no choice but to win the 2016 election,” Nana Addo said. 

On the upcoming parliamentary primary, he urged the gathering to conduct themselves and the process in a manner devoid of rancour or mudslinging, and give all aspirants the opportunity to present their case. 

At the end of the day, Nana Akufo-Addo said, ""you need to elect people you believe in, and people who will work for Ghana to succeed. Most people know that it is only the NPP who can bring prosperity, employment for the youth and progress for all. We have the men and women who can give this nation good and effective government.""

The party, Nana Addo added, must remain united after the primaries, with victors ensuring that all unsuccessful aspirants are brought on board for total victory for the party in 2016.

Nana Addo also used the opportunity to debunk NDC-inspired rumours making the rounds that he had preferred candidates in the upcoming primaries. He maintained that delegates of the party will always have the final say as to who they want as their parliamentary candidates, and that will not change.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO’S STATEMENT ON THE AL-SHABBAB ATTACKS ON GARISSA UNIVERSITY IN KENYA

I received news of Al-Shabbab’s attack on the campus of Garissa University College in Kenya with shock and sadness. I join the rest of the world in sympathising with the families of the dead and the wounded. I pray for a speedy recovery for the wounded so that they can get back to their studies. I wish to condemn unreservedly, this insane and cowardly act by Al-Shabbab. All true Muslims agree that Al-Shabbab’s actions and agenda cannot be justified under the principles and laws of Islam. No religion sanctions the killing of innocent people, especially women and children. The world must stand up together against all the atrocities that go on around the world in a twisted understanding of religion or ideology.

President Uhuru Kenyatta needs to be assured with deeds, not just words, that the world stands with Kenya and stands ready to support him in the necessary fight against such evil. The citizens of Kenya deserve to go about their daily lawful activities without being terrorised by a group of cowardly people who bastardise a peaceful religion of great good.

We must not allow an evil few to destroy a tradition of centuries of peaceful coexistence between Christians and Muslims in our parts of the world. I wish to appeal to all Kenyans to remain steadfast in their well-known spirit of tolerance and not allow themselves to be provoked into seeing their fellow Muslim compatriots as enemies. Al-Shabbab does not and cannot represent the Muslim population of either Somalia or Kenya. 

Once again, I send my sympathies to the affected families. 

May the Almighty bless us all.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"As we celebrate Easter, which marks the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, I send my best wishes to Ghanaians, Christians, and members of the New Patriotic Party.
 
For me, and for countless other Christians, Easter is a time for reflection and renewal. It reminds us of our responsibilities to God and, as God’s children, our responsibilities to one another. We remember the grace of God, who loves us so deeply that He gave us his only Son to die for us that we might be forgiven our sins and granted everlasting life. It is also a time that we recommit ourselves to following His example, to love, serve and sacrifice for one another just as He did for every one of us.

The resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day remains for the Christian the ultimate demonstration of victory over adversity. It is a testimony of a new life of hope, promise and fulfilment for those who believe and work hard towards the achievement of victory.
 
Let us celebrate Easter as a real source of hope; that there is a brighter future ahead of us. Let us use this Easter celebration to renew and strengthen our faith in God and conduct ourselves in a manner that underlines our commitment to the fact that, despite all the manifold difficulties we are encountering, there is confidence of hope for the future of our country.
 
I wish all Ghanaians a Happy Easter.
 
May God bless our country Ghana, the NPP, and us all.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO CONGRATULATES PRESIDENT-ELECT, MUHAMMADU BUHARI

I join well-wishers in the rest of Africa and across the world to extend warm congratulations to the APC presidential candidate, General Muhammadu Buhari, on his decisive victory in the March 28, 29 Nigerian presidential election, thus becoming the next President of the Federal Republic.

Through the peaceful exercise of their sovereign and democratic right to elect their own leaders, the people of Nigeria have strengthened the frontiers of democracy for all other African countries to emulate.

This is the first time, in Nigeria’s history, that one democratically elected government has been voted out for another, and that a sitting President has been rejected at the polls. This change, after 16 years of the Fourth Republic, should go a long way to enhancing the quality of competitive governance in Nigeria. It has reinforced the democratic notion that the people have the power to change governments.

President Goodluck Jonathan is to be commended for graciously conceding defeat, thereby laying to rest any lingering suspicion and anxiety about the fate of Nigeria in the aftermath of the elections.

By their exemplary conduct, both outgoing President Jonathan and his successor have reinforced the resilience of Nigeria's democracy, and demonstrated to the entire world that politics in Africa can be positively competitive, when conducted on the basis of time-honoured principles of transparency, fairness and equal opportunity.

I hope that the determination and perseverance shown over the years by General Buhari, evident in this victory, which is his 4th attempt at the Presidency, will result in him bringing his wealth of experience, as a military ruler and subsequently as an acknowledged democrat, to the fore in delivering unity, security, progress and prosperity to the Nigerian people.

I also hope that the President-elect would continue in the stead of past Nigerian leaders and deepen further the friendship that exists between Nigeria and Ghana, which has been based on a shared agenda of stability, security, development and prosperity.

Warm congratulations once again to the President-Elect, General Muhammadu Buhari, and best wishes for his success as he prepares to take up the huge responsibilities and challenges of the high office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO WISHES WASSCE STUDENTS WELL
 
This is to wish the 268,771 Senior High School students who are sitting for the West African Senior Schools Certificate Examination (WASSCE) the very best of luck, and hope that they do themselves justice.
 
Preparations towards the taking of this all-important exam have been rocky, as a result of the erratic nature of power supply facing our country these last 3½ years. The students have not found it convenient to offer any excuses for their inability to study, but, rather, have had to employ unconventional measures to enable them study. I congratulate them for that.   
 
To this end, I add my voice to calls being made by some heads of Senior High Schools asking for a reprieve from the ongoing load shedding exercise during the period of the examination. I urge government to heed this request and do all it can to ensure students are not deprived of vital learning hours due to ""dumsor dumsor"".
 
Throughout my public life, I have repeatedly stated that education is the best way by which we can dramatically change the fortunes of our country and join the group of developed nations. A society that aims to transform itself into a modern productive player in the global market, as we in Ghana must seek to do, can only do so with education and skills training of its young people. Quality, accessible education is the key to Ghana’s future and I am asking our students to seize the key with both hands and open the door to their own and Ghana’s bright future.
 
Good luck! God bless!

Every so often, history produces an individual who impacts the lives of millions of people around the world, and Lee Kuan Yew was, undoubtedly, one of such persons.  
 
His leadership of Singapore, spanning a period of 30 years, was responsible for the transformation of a small island outpost into one of the wealthiest nations in Asia. Singapore reflected the man: efficient, incorruptible, inventive, forward-looking and pragmatic. In the affairs of the region, he proved to be a great strategist and one of Asia's most influential politicians. 
 
He was not perfect, but his name will echo down the ages and will forever be remembered as a statesman, visionary and a remarkable leader. 
 
May his soul rest in perfect peace.

We must believe in Ghana and do what is right by our nation, and thereby fulfil the dreams and aspirations of those far-sighted individuals who initiated the steps for our national freedom and independence.
 
We salute and wish the people of Ghana a happy 58th Independence Anniversary.
 
God bless Ghana!

This is to congratulate the senior national football team, the Black Stars, for their impressive display in the just ended Africa Cup of Nations, where they emerged as silver medallists. 

Despite being written off by football pundits prior to the commencement of the tournament and coupled with the difficult beginning they had in their first group game against Senegal, they rallied together, showed character and determination, and gave a good account of themselves right down to the last kick of the tournament. The nation is proud of them.

We all hoped they were going to bring back the cup after we last tasted victory some 33 years ago, but it was not to be. I am, however, confident of the future of the Black Stars, who can look forward to years of unparalleled success. 

We have a solid base of good players who will emerge victorious in the next AFCON tournament in 2017, and make Ghana proud in future continental and global competitions.

The 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Akufo-Addo, has extended his deepest sympathy and solidarity to the people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia following the death of King Abdullah, which occurred on January 23, 2015, in Riyadh.

Together with the leadership of the NPP, led by National Chairman, Mr Paul Afoko; 2016 vice presidential candidate, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia; 1st vice National Chairman, Mr. Freddie Blay; General Secretary, Mr. Kwabena Agyepong and National Nasara Co-ordinator, Kamal Deen Abdulai, Nana Akufo-Addo, on Tuesday, January 27, visited the residence of the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Ghana to sign a book of condolences opened in honour of the late King.

Dr. Bawumia, Mr. Paul Afoko and Mr. Kwabena Agyepong also took turns to sign the book of condolences and paid their last respects to King Abdullah, who died at age 90.

In his brief remarks, Nana Akufo-Addo told the Saudi Ambassador to Ghana, H. E Hesham Meshal Swailem Al-Sowalem, “the NPP deemed it necessary to come and sympathise with the people of Saudi Arabia following the news of the passing of King Abdullah, who proved to be a wise ruler with a commendable interest in education.”

He expressed hope that the closeness and strength of bilateral relations that existed between Ghana and Saudi Arabia under the reign of King Abdullah will continue to grow even stronger under the new King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman, to the mutual benefit of the two populations. The NPP flagbearer, on behalf of the Party, also wished King Salman well.

On his part, H. E Hesham Meshal Swailem Al-Sowalem thanked Nana Akufo-Addo and the NPP for the kind gesture, and wished the Party and Ghana “all the best in your endeavours.” 

Also present were Party elder, Sheikh I.C Quaye, former Greater Accra Regional Minister and former Member of Parliament for Ayawaso Central; and Alhaji Rashid Bawa, Ghana's former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.",2015-01-27T17:57:31+0000,status,NA,NA,788,77,16,881

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"“Ghanaians have come to trust me” – Akufo-Addo
 
""My own sense is that the Ghanaian people have come to trust me. Contrary to the propaganda, they know that I will not put my ambition and self-interest before the wellbeing of the country. They know I have been sincere and consistent with what I believe we must do to bring about prosperity for everyone.”
 
These were the words of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, in response to a question posed by Dr Alex Vines OBE, Head of the Africa Programme at Chatham House, the prestigious Royal Institute of International Affairs, a major British Think Tank, on Wednesday, January 21, 2014.
 
Dr. Vines wanted to find out from Nana Akufo-Addo why he believed he would be third time lucky in securing the Presidency, when the latter addressed a roundtable discussion on the theme, “Developing Ghana – Policies for Prosperity”.
 
Explaining further, with a big smile, why he believed Ghanaians have come to trust him, Nana Akufo-Addo said, “When I go around the country, I sense this and it is like, after all let us give him a chance for him to show what he can do.""
 
These final words brought the house down with claps and laughter at the 90 minute interaction. 
 
Nana earlier explained that Ghanaians now have a clearer scale to measure the 8 years of NDC to the NPP's, adding that Ghanaians are becoming more and more convinced that “we in the NPP can be trusted to better manage the economy and create the opportunities for prosperity.”
 
He reassured the invited gathering, composed of high-level business executives, diplomats and policy analysts, that his vision of ensuring “education for all” school going children remained unshaken, stressing that the ""value of having an educated population is more than the cost."" 
 
The NPP flagbearer added that his administration will also pay critical attention to technical education “in this critical phase of our development” with a ""major emphasis on science and technology, which will feature heavily.""
 
On the economy, Nana Akufo-Addo said his government would ensure fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability, to curb inflation, bring down interest rates and move away from the high fiscal deficits and reckless borrowing that has characterised the Mahama government thus far. 
 
Additionally, his government, he said, would introduce a deliberate policy measure to achieve financial inclusion by moving the majority of citizens from cash to electronic payments (debit cards) for transactions. To do this well, ""we need a national database that identifies every citizen with an address,"" he said.
 
This, Nana Akufo-Addo said, will assist in formalising the economy, spread the tax burden, help government to plan better with statistics and dramatically increase savings in the financial system.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo, also lamented the current “governance arrangement” in Ghana where Parliament, he said, is seemingly subservient to the Executive, calling for a greater oversight control over the Executive in the use of public funds.
 
The overarching question that must be in the heart of all Ghanaians, he said, “is how we are going to raise rapidly the quality of life of the mass of our people.”
 
On the 2016 election, the NPP flagbearer stated that there's a national consensus to enhance the integrity of the electoral system. He assured that more would be done to get better and fairer election process.",2015-01-22T10:49:17+0000,status,NA,NA,2339,417,110,2866

I believe that a brighter future awaits Ghana. I am confident that we will make it if we work at it. We must believe in Ghana’s prospects and do what is right by our nation to enable us fulfil the noble dreams and aspirations of our founding Fathers.

Let us renew our commitment to their dreams of creating in our lifetime, that free, democratic, and prosperous nation governed under the rule of law. A nation whose citizens are reconciled with themselves and have self-confidence generated by access to good education, skills training and a buoyant economy. With the guidance of the Almighty, we can make it and secure our future.

On behalf of the entire membership of the New Patriotic Party, I wish to congratulate our farmers and fishermen on this day as we acknowledge their hard work and commitment over the years.
 
Agriculture remains the fuel that powers all our activity in Ghana, and the NPP is indeed proud the good works of our farmers and fishermen, and we congratulate every one of you on this day.
 
It remains an undeniable fact that more than 50% of our population are engaged in agriculture. If, as a country, we are to make any meaningful change in the lives of the people therefore, our efforts must be directed at this sector. The majority of people can only feel a change in their lives when we develop agriculture.
 
The transformation and modernisation of our agriculture to enhance productivity and guarantee food security are the vital issues of our time. I am confident that with the necessary support and incentives, the Ghanaian farmer will be up to the task.
 
I congratulate all award winners in this year’s National Best Farmers' Day Awards and I hope that your exploits and achievements would be an inspiration for others to the benefit of the Ghanaian people.

Nine Regional Chairmen of the New Patriotic Party, together with the 2nd Vice Regional Chairman from the Greater Accra Region, who was standing in for his Regional Chairman who is currently out of the country, on Monday, December 1, 2014, took delivery of the 100 motorbikes promised by Nana Akufo-Addo as his way of saying thank you to the delegates of the party for their tremendous show of support in the October 18 presidential primary.

It will be recalled that on November 13, 2014, Nana Akufo-Addo, in an open letter to all NPP members, indicated that he had begun “the process of mobilising resources and logistics, ahead of election 2016, for the prosecution of an effective campaign.”

Nana Akufo-Addo added that “in view of this, friends of mine and I have begun the first phase of equipping the party which will see every region receive ten (10) motorbikes.”

At a short “handing-over” ceremony held at his Nima residence, Nana Akufo-Addo assured the Regional Chairmen that this was the beginning of the journey to wrestling power from the incompetent John Mahama government, adding that more resources will be made available to every constituency beginning from 2015.

The Upper West Regional Chairman, Alhaji Abubakar Abdul Rahaman, on behalf of the Regional Chairmen, thanked Nana Akufo-Addo for fulfilling the pledge he made to them on November 13.

He added that “we (NPP) have now started on a very good note. I believe that God will help Nana Akufo-Addo so that he will give us more support, and also we pray that God will help us to deliver this time for the NPP and Ghana.”",2014-12-01T18:42:01+0000,status,NA,NA,853,121,25,999

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Dear NPP member,

THANK YOU NPP DELEGATES

On Saturday, October 18, 2014, some 125,000 delegates from all 275 constituencies in the 10 regions of the country went to designated polling centres to elect a presidential candidate to lead our great party, the New Patriotic Party, into the 2016 presidential election.

This election resulted in 117,413 delegates, representing 94.35%, voting for me as the presidential candidate of our party. The message of this emphatic victory is clear – I have to deliver power for the party and the nation in 2016.

The best way I can say thank you to the NPP for this tremendous show of support is to begin the process of mobilising resources and logistics, ahead of election 2016, for the prosecution of an effective campaign. In view of this, friends of mine and I have begun the first phase of equipping the party which will see every region receive ten (10) motorbikes. The motorbikes will be delivered to the Regional Chairmen this week.

As I said on the night of the victory, at the Efua Sutherland Children’s Park, “we have now to gird up our loins, put ourselves together and get ready to face the big battle of 2016. We must rid our country, through the peace of the ballot box, of this incompetent NDC government of John Dramani Mahama, and relieve the Ghanaian people of the unjustifiable hardships and difficulties they are encountering.”     

The process of restoring hope to millions of Ghanaians and building a future of progress and prosperity has begun.

Thank you and God bless.

Dear Chief Obosu Mohammed,
 
Re: WALKING THE PATH TO VICTORY
 
This is to thank you for your open letter, dated October 24, 2014, congratulating me on my “emphatic victory” of October 18 in the presidential primary of our great party, the New Patriotic Party. The nature of the victory provides a rallying point for strong cohesion amongst the rank and file and members of the Party for the drive to power in 2016.
 
As aptly put by ‘my man’, Alan Kyerematen, the man you worked for as press aide, the NPP tradition is best exemplified in the statement “after competition comes co-operation”, and I see your letter in that spirit.  I am determined, in a “camp-blind” manner, to assemble all the talents in our Party so that we can realise the great task of mobilising the overwhelming majority of the Ghanaian people for victory in 2016. The NPP programme of transformation and development is a credible platform around which we can unite the people of Ghana for lasting progress and prosperity.
 
I share your concern about the conduct of our members over “rejected ballots.” Education has to be a priority.   
 
I am glad that you support so strongly the nomination of Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia as my running mate.
 
I am confident that, with co-operation amongst ourselves, Ghana will work again with an NPP government at the helm of affairs.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO CALLS ON NPP NATIONAL OFFICERS
 
The 2016 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on Tuesday, October 21, paid a courtesy call on the national officers of the Party to assure them of his fullest co-operation ahead of the upcoming 2016 general election.
 
The meeting, which was held at the Party Headquarters at the behest of Nana Akufo-Addo, saw all but two of the Party’s officers attending, with the Chairman of the National Council of Elders, Mr. C.K Tedam, also in attendance.
 
At the meeting, chaired by NPP National Chairman, Mr. Paul Afoko, Nana Akufo-Addo indicated that the sole motive for his request was to assure the national officers of his “fullest co-operation, so that the common endeavour of achieving victory in 2016, and producing a good government come January 2017 will be realised.”
 
Nana Akufo-Addo further assured the executives that “you will find nothing lacking in me as far as co-operation goes. We are to work together to change Ghana and bring about the transformation of our country. So my main purpose here, this morning, is to introduce myself to you, assure you of my fullest co-operation and to let you know that I am ready to play my part in the common agenda of victory in 2016.”
 
Speaking on behalf of the national officers, Ms. Otiko Afisa Djaba, the National Women’s Organiser of the Party, congratulated Nana Akufo-Addo for his emphatic victory in last Saturday’s presidential primary, stating that the party has spoken clearly in one unequivocal vocie.
 
“It is always said that the voice of the people is the voice of God. It is therefore the responsibility of all of us to bring NPP into power in 2016. We have to bury all our differences and bring the NPP into power,” she stressed.  
 
On his part, Mr. C.K. Tedam, a veteran activist of the Danquah-Dombo-Busia political tradition, advised the gathering to do everything humanly possible to make sure the party wins 2016, adding that “united we stand, divided we fall”, a charge to Akufo-Addo and the national officers to work hand-in-hand to ensure victory in 2016.
 
Giving his concluding remarks, Mr. Paul Afoko also assured Nana Akufo-Addo that the entire party machinery will be entirely supportive of his candidature, with a charge to the gathering to ensure that true meaning is given to the ‘unity’ that the party is seeking.
 
“This unity we are all talking about, we must live it and actively work to ensure that we have the unity. We (national officers) can assure you (Nana Akufo-Addo) that we will work together to make sure that the NPP wins 2016. The NPP has no choice but to win 2016. The NPP and Ghana cannot afford another four years of this NDC government,” Mr. Paul Afoko said.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo was accompanied to the meeting by Hon. Frema Opare, former Member of Parliament for Ayawaso West Wuogon and former Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Welfare; Mr. Victor Newman, his long-time associate and founding member of the Party; Mr. Francis Asenso-Boakye, Political Assistant to Nana Akufo-Addo; and Mr. Eugene Arhin, Media Secretary.
 
Earlier on Tuesday morning, Mr. Alan Kyerematen, an aspirant in the just ended NPP primary, together with members of his team including Nana Ohene Ntow, Hon. Kofi Dzamesi, Mr. Moses Osei Bonsu (“Patak”) and Mr. Philip Longdon, also called on Nana Akufo-Addo to pledge his and the support of his team to ensuring that the NPP, with Nana Akufo-Addo as its presidential candidate, emerged victorious in the 2016 election.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo re-echoed statements made by Alan Kyerematen at the Efua Sutherland Children’s park to the effect that the tradition of the NPP has been that “after competition comes co-operation.”
 
“The Ghanaian people are expecting a lot from us. It requires that those of us in the leadership of the party work together to fulfil their desires and wishes. Anybody who knows the two of us knows there is no difficulty in us working together. We have done so in the past and I have every expectation that we will do so again closely in the future to bring about change in the country. Ghanaians are desperately looking for a change and it is up to us to ensure that they get it,” Nana Addo said.",2014-10-21T15:32:11+0000,status,NA,NA,1081,228,63,1372

This is the day the Lord has made; We will rejoice and be glad in it.
 
I thank the Lord Almighty for his continuing blessings on our beloved Ghana, the NPP and myself.
 
I thank, from the bottom of my heart, the thousands and thousands of NPP members – polling station executives, electoral area co-ordinators, constituency executives, regional executives, National Council and National Executive Committee members, National Council of Elders, Members of Parliament, past national officers, founding members and ordinary members and youth of the party – for this overwhelming show of support. I am profoundly grateful and truly humbled by the massive confidence you have reposed in me. You have put an enormous responsibility on my modest shoulders, but I want to assure you that I shall do everything humanly possible, under the guidance of Almighty God, to justify your confidence.
 
I congratulate my opponents, Alan Kwadwo Kyerematen and Hon. Francis Addai-Nimo, for their competition, and appreciate the gracious call that Alan Kyerematen made to me earlier this evening about my victory. I congratulate also those who did not make the shortlist of five and those who did, but dropped out of the race to support me, my good friends, Hon. Joe Ghartey and Hon. Kofi Osei-Ameyaw. We will all co-operate and work together to advance the cause of the NPP and Mother Ghana. That is what the people of Ghana and the membership of the NPP expect of us.
 
I am grateful to those in the party, from the national to the polling station level, who were responsible for the organisation of this successful election, and to the members of the Electoral Commission, who supervised it. My thanks also to the Police Force for their service.
 
I thank warmly all those who supported my candidature and participated in my campaign.  This historic result could not have been achieved without your hard work and enthusiasm.
 
I acknowledge with thanks the extensive coverage given to the conduct of the campaign by the media.
 
My final thanks goes to my beautiful lady, my wife Rebecca, my children and family for their constant support and encouragement. Without them, I cannot go forth.
 
Tonight’s declaration brings to an end the process of internal reorganisation of our party. We have now to gird up our loins, put ourselves together and get ready to face the big battle of 2016. We, in the NPP, have a sacred, two-fold duty. We must rid our country, through the peace of the ballot box, of this incompetent NDC government of John Dramani Mahama, and relieve the Ghanaian people of the unjustifiable hardships and difficulties they are encountering. We are then to form a government for Ghana where we will reverse the decline of our nation, do the work of the Ghanaian people with integrity and bring about their rapid progress and prosperity. We have the men and women who can do it. We can fulfil, in our generation, the dreams and ambitions of our founding fathers to build a free, prosperous, modern African nation, governed on the principles of democratic accountability, the rule of law and social justice. Let us be up and doing.
 
God bless Ghana. God bless the NPP. God bless Mother Africa.
 
Thank you.",2014-10-18T22:32:52+0000,status,NA,NA,3897,1239,383,5519

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"ELECTION LOOPHOLES WILL BE PLUGGED, AKUFO-ADDO ASSURES NPP DELEGATES

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, who is seeking the mandate of the 140,000 plus delegates of the New Patriotic Party as its presidential candidate for the 2016 election, has assured the rank and file of the party as well all well-meaning Ghanaians that the NPP will ensure that loopholes in Ghana’s electoral system are plugged before the conduct of the 2016 election.

Reiterating a pledge he has made to the delegates throughout the course of the electioneering period, Nana Akufo-Addo told the 400 delegates of the party from the Effutu Constituency, when he met them on Wednesday, October 15, that “never in the history of Ghana will we see twenty seven transform itself into ‘twenty seven zero’. It will never happen again”

“We are going to make sure that the loopholes in our electoral system are plugged, so that the true will of the Ghanaian voter is upheld in every election. When that happens, the NPP will always emerge victorious,” he said. 

“With hard work and proper organization, this time we are going to make sure we have a level playing field, so that at the end of the day, a declaration will be made by the new head of the Electoral Commission that the NPP presidential candidate, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has been elected President of Ghana,” Nana Addo said.

Accompanied by Central Regional NPP Chairman, Robert Kutin; Hon. Dr. Nana Ato Arthur, MP for KEEA; Hon. Alex Markin, MP for Effutu; and Hon. Kwamena Bartels, NPP National Council Member, Nana Akufo-Addo appealed to the delegates to vote massively for him on Saturday

Reinforcing the comments expressed by Nana Akufo-Addo in the Effutu Constituency, the Member of Parliament for Assin Central, Hon. Ken Agyepong, assured NPP delegates that the battle to wrestle power from the NDC will be fought at the polling station level.

According to him, whilst addressing delegates from Awutu Senya Constituency when Nana Akufo-Addo took his campaign to the constituency, the NPP will make no mistakes this time around and allow the kinds of collusion between the NDC and the EC to rob this nation of its rightful government.

 

It is Akufo-Addo’s time

Also at Awutu Beraku, in the Awutu Senya West constituency, Regional Co-ordinator for Nana Akufo-Addo’s campaign in the Central Region, Hon. Dr. Nana Ato Arthur indicated to the delegates that the clarion call of “No Nana No Vote” by Ghanaians is because “Ghanaians acknowledge that it is Akufo-Addo’s time.”

Applauding the “Super delegates” from the region for 94.4% they gave Nana Akufo-Addo in the August 31 Special Electoral College, Hon. Dr. Nana Ato Arthur asked the 524 delegates to better this feat come Saturday.

Nana Akufo-Addo’s tour of the Central Region saw him visit the Awutu Senya West, Gomoa East, Effutu and Awutu Senya East constituencies on Wednesday. He will wrap up his campaign on Thursday, October 16, as he addresses Greater Accra delegates and party supporters in a mini rally to be held in front of Avenue Chemist, Opposite Abrantie Spot, Abeka Lapaz, Accra, a popular location for NPP events.",2014-10-16T09:26:25+0000,status,NA,NA,866,161,42,1069

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Re: Akufo-Addo’s health alert…

Once again, Ghanaweb has allowed its online ‘news’ outlet to be used to publish outright lies about Nana Akufo-Addo, by reproducing a story that was published on the front page of one of Ghana’s ruling party’s propaganda tabloids, the Republic, Monday, 7th October.
 
The following false claims were made in the said publication:-
1)    Claim: Nana Akufo-Addo’s health “may have relapsed, sending worrying signals through his campaign, the Republic newspaper has gathered.”
Fact: Nana Akufo-Addo has suffered no health relapse. He has been on the campaign trail as scheduled in his bid to be elected the 2016 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party on October 18, 2014. He finished his campaign in the Brong Ahafo Region on Monday and he is now in the Ashanti Region, from where he will move to the Eastern Region. The only worrying signal must be in the camps of those who wish him ill.
 
2)    Claim: “Hints picked up by this newspaper indicates that the over 75-year-old aspiring presidential flagbearer of the NPP was last Tuesday taken under medical observation at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital.”
Fact (i): Nana Akufo-Addo is not 75 years old; he is also not over 75. He celebrated his 70th birthday last March and we thank God for his life and well-meaning Ghanaians continue to pray for long life for him, knowing the plans he has for our dear nation.
Fact (ii): Nana Akufo-Addo was not taken last Tuesday to Korle Bu or any other hospital for medical observation. That claim is a complete fabrication.
 
3)    Claim: Sources told this paper that Akufo-Addo stayed at the premier hospital overnight. ”
Fact: Nana Akufo-Addo has not stayed overnight at Korle Bu or any other hospital since returning to Ghana in March to launch his campaign.
 
4)    Claim: “According to unconfirmed reports, doctors at the hospital advised him to be flown out of the country for better attention to his alleged heart condition.”
Fact (i):  Akufo-Addo could not have been advised by any doctor to be flown out for treatment since he hadn’t been to see any doctor as alleged. For the avoidance of doubt, he has no scheduled trip abroad for any medical treatment.
Fact (ii): He has no heart condition that would necessitate being flown out for treatment.
 
5)    Claim: “The octogenarian flagbearer hopeful of the NPP is said to be due for a surgery in November 2014.”
Fact: Akufo-Addo is not an octogenarian. An octogenarian is a person between the age of 80 and 89. This claim further exposes the undignified agenda of the paper. The 70-year-old they claim in the story that he is 75 has been elevated in the same story to be in his 80s.
 
6)    Claim: “Sources close to the ailing flagbearer told this newspaper that he would be abroad for three months. The source however denied he was going for medical treatment.”
Fact: Nana Akufo-Addo has no plans to travel abroad for three months. He is focusing on the October 18 contest and his schedule after that date would be determined by the result of the flagbearership contest.
 
7)    Claim: “Due to Akufo-Addo’s reported deteriorating health, his campaign scope is said to have been adjusted to reduce pressure on him; his running-mate, Dr. Mahmud Bawumia is said to have been tasked to handle his campaign in the Volta Region and the three northern regions while he [Akufo Addo] handles the remaining six regions.”
Fact:  In order to prosecute an effective campaign and within the time available, Nana Akufo-Addo has appointed sector and regional coordinators for his campaign. Dr Bawumia has served all throughout the campaign for the NPP flagbearership as Nana Akufo-Addo’s sector coordinator for the three regions in the North, just as Stephen Ntim has served as sector co-ordinator for the “Middle Belt” (Brong Ahafo, Ashanti and Eastern Regions), Hon. Kennedy Agyepong for the “South West” (Western and Central Regions), and Hon. Stanley Adjiri Blankson for the “South East” (Volta and Greater Accra Regions). Nana Akufo-Addo is very happy with the excellent work that his 2012 running mate is doing, along with the other sector and regional co-ordinators. He believes he is lucky to have an effective right-hand man in the person of Dr Bawumia, and, indeed, in the persons of his other sector and regional co-ordinators.
 
8)    Claim: “He was reported to have collapsed at home once and rushed to Akai House medical facility at Osu in Accra.”
Fact: This is not true. Nana Akufo-Addo never collapsed at home to be rushed to any medical facility.
 
9)    Claim: Inside the NPP, there have been claims that Nana Addo has a kidney problem and even recently went abroad for medical treatment.
Fact:  Nana Akufo-Addo does not have a kidney problem. He has not travelled abroad recently for any medical treatment. Since his return from the United Kingdom in March this year, he has been abroad on three occasions: i) to Nigeria, on March 25th, where he went as guest speaker at Verdant Zeal’s 3rd Innovention Lecture series in Lagos; ii) to South Africa, from May 1st to May 18th, where he led the Commonwealth Observer Mission to the South African general elections of 7th May; and iii) to England on 20th June for a ten-day visit.
 
10)  Claim: During the Election Petition hearing at the Supreme Court, Akufo-Addo is said to have abandoned the case and travelled abroad for medical treatment.
Fact: Yes, in the course of the election petition, Nana Akufo-Addo’s office issued a statement that he was going to London for scheduled engagements, including a medical check-up, which could not be varied. The whole world knows that he did not abandon the case and made arrangements to be fully represented in his absence.
 
When notifying the nation, on March 20th, of his intention to seek the presidential nomination of the NPP, when nominations opened, Nana Akufo-Addo said “I thank the Almighty I am able to say that I feel spiritually, psychologically, emotionally, intellectually, physically, and patriotically strong enough to remain in the hurly burly of frontline politics.” He stands by that statement.
 
We recognise that Akufo-Addo’s record of public service, both to party and nation, remains a formidable obstacle to the political ambitions of those who are determined, despite the corruption, incompetence and mismanagement of their rule, to perpetuate themselves in power and who will, therefore, go to any extents to try to blacken him. The “health alert” is the latest incident in this long line of nefarious propaganda.
 
He is, however, confident of the strength of his message, his vision, his candidacy, and his body and, by the grace of God, he will win, first, the endorsement of his party on October 18 and in the 2016 general elections Ghanaians will go on to give him the opportunity to serve as President to realise his great vision for his beloved country. 
 
We have taken the trouble to answer these falsehoods in detail, in the hope that it will put to rest all these wishful speculations by malicious opponents. We believe the good people of Ghana will see these falsehoods for what they are, even when efforts continue to be made to manufacture them.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Everything NDC touches turns to dust, says Akufo-Addo
 
Day two of the final phase of Nana Akufo-Addo’s campaign ahead of the October 18 presidential primary of the New Patriotic Party saw him visit the Pru East, Pru West and Atebubu Amantin constituencies of the Brong Ahafo Region on Monday, October 6.
 
Nana Addo, prior to interacting with delegates in the Pru East Constituency visited, Yeji harbour, where he witnessed at first hand the plight of fishermen and boat owners who had queued for days with “Kufuor gallons” and drums in search of premix fuel.
 
Visibly frustrated at their inability to undertake their core business activities, which predominantly require the use of premix fuel, residents of Yeji told Nana Addo that economic activity had slowed down due to the shortage, resulting largely in increasing hardships amongst the residents.
 
Apart from the shortage of premix fuel, fisherfolk told Nana Akufo-Addo about the exorbitant prices they have to pay for the commodity as and when it becomes available, with a gallon of premix selling at between GH¢12 and GH¢15 as opposed to the ex-pump price of GH¢6.
 
Addressing the 392 delegates, made up of 360 polling station executives, 16 electoral area co-ordinators, and 16 constituency executives, Nana Akufo-Addo expressed deep worry about the mess the country has been plunged into under President John Mahama.
 
According to Nana Addo, Ghana, a country blessed with abundant human and natural resources, should not be in this current predicament, adding that “everything John Mahama and this government touches turns into dust.”      
 
He noted that prior to the exiting of the President John Kufuor’s NPP government in January 2009, a gallon of premix sold at GH¢1.79, explaining that the shortage of premix and its attendant price hikes should be placed solely at the doorstep of the NDC government, adding that “it is bad governance that has gotten us this far.”
 
""Businesses are collapsing, our educational system is in disarray. When someone is sick, it becomes a heart-wrenching issue, because our healthcare system is in a mess. This is not the Ghana we all want,"" he stated.
 
The beauty of multiparty democracy, according to Nana Akufo-Addo, is that it presents the Ghanaian electorate with the opportunity, through the thumb, to vote out peacefully this non-performing Mahama government and replace it with a competent NPP government led by Nana Akufo-Addo come December 6, 2016.
 
A government under his leadership, Nana Addo explained, will ensure the rapid industrialisation of the Ghanaian economy and move this nation from a producer and exporter of raw materials to an economy that will add value to the country's raw materials. This, he said, is the sure way of creating the hundreds of thousands of jobs needed for the growing masses of unemployed youth.
 
To restore Ghana back onto the path of progress and prosperity, Nana Akufo-Addo appealed to the delegates to vote massively for him to send a clear message to Ghanaians that the party is focused, united behind its candidate and ready to wrestle political power from the NDC government. 
 
Pru West promise vote increase for Akufo-Addo
Nana Akufo-Addo’s next point of call was Prang, in the Pru West constituency. There, Nana Akufo-Addo was assured of a massive increment in the votes he received in the 2010 primary from the constituency.
 
Pru, it will be recalled, gave Nana Akufo-Addo a 55% margin of victory in the 2010 presidential primary, with the Pru West constituency chairman, K.K. Kwarteng, assuring Nana Akufo-Addo that Pru West will emerges as one of the highest contributors of votes to Nana Akufo-Addo in October 18 presidential primary.
 
“If they (NDC) had persons of the calibre of Nana Akufo-Addo and Dr. Bawumia in their midst, there was no way it would have held a presidential primary to elect a flagbearer, and in turn, a running mate,” Chairman Kwarteng said, to a great applause from the delegates.
 
Atebubu Amantin follows suit
The delegates of Atebubu Amantin constituency, through their chairman, Mr. Edward Owusu, promised to better the 67% margin of victory they gave Akufo-Addo in the 2010 presidential primary.
 
Mr. Edward Owusu together with all the 712 delegates assured Nana Addo of nothing less than a 95% margin of victory.
 
Also addressing the delegates, Brong Ahafo Regional Youth Organizer, Mr. Michael Osei Boateng, admonished the delegates to disregard calls being made in certain quarters for the changing of Nana Akufo-Addo in favour of another presidential candidate.
 
“Even President Mahama is backing 72-year old Alassane Ouattara to lead Cote d’Ivoire for a second term. Why then do we hear NDC supporters and some NPP members saying we should change Akufo-Addo who is 70 years old? Akufo-Addo has proven to be a visionary leader, and that is why the NDC have resorted to stealing his programmes like the free senior high school policy and the Northern Development Authority which they re-named to SADA,” Mr. Osei Boateng added.",2014-10-06T16:47:31+0000,status,NA,NA,979,199,60,1238

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"“OCTOBER 18 IS ABOUT GHANA, NOT NPP” – AKUFO-ADDO
 
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo says the impending October 18 presidential primary of the New Patriotic Party is about the future of Ghana, and not merely about the selection of an NPP flagbearer to contest the December 2016 election.
 
Beginning the final phase of his campaign ahead of NPP presidential primary from Kajeji, in the Sene East constituency of the Brong Ahafo Region on Sunday, October 5, Nana Akufo-Addo explained to the NPP delegates that “what is important is ensuring that Ghanaians will have the confidence to give the NPP the opportunity to remove the incompetent NDC administration.  That is what is important.”
 
After October 18, Akufo-Addo urged the delegates to be guided constantly by an uncompromising sense of victory in 2016, as this is the only way to restore Ghana back onto the path of progress and prosperity.
 
Addressing hundreds of residents of Kajeji, including the 300 polling station executives of the constituency, Nana Addo stated that the NDC has shown, in its tenure of office spanning almost 6 years, that it cannot provide the basic needs of Ghanaians, citing the example of the deplorable road network linking the Sene East and West constituencies.
 
He recounted how the late President Mills cut the sod, awarded the contract for the construction of the road and the pump and pageantry that characterized the supposed commencement of construction.
 
However, 3 years down the line, “we haven’t seen anything. An Akufo-Addo government will use less than 3 years to complete this important stretch of road if given the opportunity. We (NPP) are not asking for power to enrich ourselves… we want power to help Ghana.”
 
“We want to make sure the youth find employment. We want to ensure that education does not become an unbearable burden for parents, to be able to fix your roads for you and to bring prosperity to every Ghanaian,” he said.
 
In order for these to be achieved, Nana Addo appealed to the gathering to, firstly, vote for him as the flagbearer of the NPP and secondly, help push the NPP into the Jubilee House come January 2017.
 
The NPP, according to Nana Addo, has never won in the Sene East constituency since the onset of multi-party democracy in the country in 1992, and yet the constituency has seen no marked improvement in their standard of living under the NDC.
 
“I appeal to you that in 2016, try the NPP and see for yourselves if we can do the job or not. If you vote for us and we are not able to turn around your fortunes in 4 years, simply kick us out,” he emphasized.
 
In view of this, Nana Akufo-Addo appealed to the delegates of the NPP to vote massively for him, as this will send a clear message to Ghanaians and the ruling NDC government that the NPP is solidly united behind its presidential candidate and ready to ensure a decent standard of living for all Ghanaians.
 
Rally behind primary winner
A distinguishing feature of Nana Akufo-Addo’s campaign all across the country, thus far, has been the thronging of campaign meeting venues of the NPP and its probable candidate by large numbers of youth. A similar scenario panned out at Kwame Danso in the Sene West constituency on Sunday.
 
Addressing the gathering at Kwame Danso, Nana Akufo-Addo reiterated his appeal to the delegates to vote for him and ensure that he obtains a massive victory on October 18.
 
He further urged the rank and file of the party to rally behind the winner of the primary, no matter which aspirant they supported in this course of campaigning, as “this has always been the NPP way.”",2014-10-06T11:40:51+0000,status,NA,NA,1398,238,91,1727

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"ADDRESS BY NANA AKUFO-ADDO ON RESULTS OF NPP SPECIAL ELECTORAL COLLEGE OF 31ST AUGUST 2014

Ladies and Gentlemen of the Media,

Today, in accordance with our Party’s Constitution, elections were held in our Party all across the country to prune down the number of presidential aspirants from 7 to 5.

I am very grateful for the decision of the Special Electoral College and the confidence that its delegates have reaffirmed in me by this overwhelming endorsement, which gave me 80.81% of the votes cast. I thank them for listening to the grassroots. When I went around the country, all our delegates told me that their people on the ground were calling for me. The delegates gave me their promises and truly they have delivered. I am really touched by that.

My special gratitude to my campaign team and all the people who have worked tirelessly across the country to put me in this position.

The overwhelming endorsement is truly humbling. Today’s results show, I believe, that the party continues to remain emphatically united behind me.

I congratulate the Party's leadership for organising these elections peacefully and without any hitches. I also congratulate my fellow contestants for participating in this contest and for running such a thorough campaign. We are all members of the great elephant family, and I trust that we will all work together to advance the cause of the NPP and, even more importantly, of mother Ghana.

I, myself, reemphasize my commitment to working for a united NPP, focused on a common opponent whom we must beat convincingly in the 2016 elections. Our nation must be put back again on the path to prosperity. Even though the work ahead will be arduous, I am confident that, together, we will answer the call of the Ghanaian people for a new beginning, a new path away from corruption, incompetence and mismanagement. The youth and people of our country need jobs, good education, quality healthcare, decent housing and an enhanced standard of living. Without running ahead of myself, I can say that an NPP government under my leadership will make these things a reality.

Together, we can rally the Ghanaian people to regain confidence in our future. To believe in the bright horizon and compelling prospects that await the Black Star of Africa. To be convinced that, with purposeful leadership, we can claim our rightful position in the affairs of Africa and of the World.

We cannot and will not fail the people of Ghana. I thank the Almighty God for his continued blessings on Ghana, the NPP and myself.

Thank you.",2014-08-31T18:54:41+0000,status,NA,NA,2743,1118,204,4065

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"SPEECH DELIVERED ON 29TH AUGUST, 2014, BY NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO AT GEORGIA HOTEL, KUMASI, ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE VERDICT ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PETITION
 
Various dates become part of a nation’s collective memory for all kinds of reasons. There are dates with political significance like our independence day; birthdays of famous people like the first leader of our nation, Kwame Nkrumah; there are dates on which things happened that we dare not forget, like the day on which the father of our independence movement, Joseph Boakye Danquah, died tragically in detention without trial. To commemorate those days, be they happy ones or ones of intense sadness, is to make sure we keep the lessons of those events fresh and learn from them.
 
Exactly one year ago, on 29th August, 2013, the Supreme Court, the highest court of our nation, delivered a 5-4 majority judgement that brought an end to the election petition that Otanka Obetsebi-Lamptey, Mahamudu Bawumia and I had filed on behalf of the NPP. After proceedings that lasted for eight months of high drama, the Court rejected the petition and declared President John Dramani Mahama the legitimate winner of the 2012 elections.
 
As the case progressed and the details of what went on at the elections emerged, many were openly contemplating the probability of a sitting president being asked to step down. The world looked on and held its breath and worried about the stability of our nation. Some predicted doom and the outbreak of violence at whatever verdict came from the Court. Everybody prayed and there were many raw nerves on that August 29 morning.
 
It did not help matters that the court proceedings on that morning were, unfortunately, somewhat bizarre, raising tensions to almost intolerable levels.
But, ladies and gentlemen, Ghana came out with her peaceable and democratic credentials enhanced. We proved to the world that we were willing and able to submerge our individual and partisan preferences to the common good. We demonstrated clearly that it was not the ambitions of Akufo-Addo, it was not the fortunes of the NPP that we sought to promote. The stability and progress of Ghana was the paramount consideration that guided our every action in those difficult days.
 
At the beginning, some questioned whether we should ever have gone to court at all. By the end, I believe it is fair to say that question was answered comprehensively and with unintended consequences. New words and phrases have entered our lexicon; “you and I were not there""; ""the finger of God”; and Dr Bawumia has acquired new titles, out of which my favourite is Dr Pink Sheet.
 
The message from the majority on the Court was clear: we might agree with a petitioner that strange things occurred during the elections, we might all be dissatisfied with the performance of polling agents, we might ask for presiding officers that are literate and numerate, we might even agonize about infractions of electoral regulations, but what happens at the polling station is sacred and results declared there will not be reversed.
 
We have taken that message to heart.
 
I suspect that the Electoral Commissioner will no longer be in a hurry to tell anybody to go to court when the actions of the Commission are challenged. I am certain most of us will hesitate to take electoral matters to court; the lessons have been well learnt. The NPP is taking these hard lessons seriously and will approach all future elections with the experience of the Court very firmly in mind. A major lesson is the need for maximum vigilance on the part of NPP people so that we can protect our votes and ensure that our victory is correctly recorded and reported from the polling station.
 
The greater lesson for us as a nation is that we seek to improve our electoral process as a whole, based on the revelations that emerged from the court hearings. The strength of any democracy is very much determined by the credibility of its electoral process and it is in everybody’s interest that we all develop an instinctive respect for the rules and regulations set out for our elections. Never again should anybody feel tempted or emboldened to tamper with any aspect of the voting process -- the registration, the verification, the casting of ballots, the counting, the tabulation or the declaration. The idea of anybody in the electoral process changing the figure 27 to “twenty-seven zero” should shame us all.
 
We must work to ensure that there should not be any lingering questions about the legitimacy of an election and the winning candidate at the end of the process should receive the unalloyed support of all. There will always be winners and losers in an election; that is the system of governance we have chosen. It is painful enough to lose an election, I can testify to that; but the pain should not come with a suspicion of having been cheated. We should be able to congratulate the winner enthusiastically and extend the support needed for our many problems to be tackled. This will ensure that the winner has some time and peace of mind for the serious business of governance, without having to deal with the nonstop politicking of the electoral cycle.
 
A recent ruling by the Supreme Court on the use of NHIS cards will be helpful in making the distinction between those who are citizens and qualified to vote in our elections and those who are our neighbours or residents in the country and can use our health facilities.
 
The election petition also had the effect of bringing the Supreme Court and its officials and practices into the public space. For the first time, the proceedings of the court were covered live on public television. It turned out to have been a steep learning curve for all concerned. I am glad that the Chief Justice took the brave decision to have allowed the cameras into the court. This has contributed very much to a better understanding of the proceedings and I am certain posterity will thank us all. The advantages from the public airing might not be too obvious to the justices at this stage, but it is certainly for the public good that the judicial process has been demystified.
 
Ghanaians everywhere should come together, irrespective of our political affiliations, to demand peacefully the best for our country. Going into the 2016 elections, let us demand that the Electoral Commission implements the reforms recommended by the Supreme Court, the Ghana Political Parties Programme (made up of the NPP, NDC, CPP, PPP, PNC, GCPP) and civil society to safeguard and ensure the credibility and integrity of our elections.
 
The Electoral Commission must work with these and all other stakeholders to ensure that Ghana has a reliable electoral system. Ghanaians deserve and demand a reliable electoral system, which is necessary for the peace and stability of our nation and the growth of our democracy. We must insist that the Electoral Commission makes a serious effort at implementing electoral reforms. Chief amongst these has, surely, to be the making of a new, accurate voters' register to replace the bloated one we have at present. That is the way to guaranteeing a credible base document for our future elections.
 
Today, we can look back on 29 August, 2013, as the day that marked a significant coming of age in the Ghanaian democratic process. Personally, the day might have brought a painful and difficult end to the 2012 elections, but it also helped me see my compatriots in an admirable light. As a Ghanaian, I will be forever proud of the way we elected to deal with our victory and our disappointment; I will always remember that when it came to the crunch, we placed the interest of our nation above that of ourselves and groups, and I will never forget the dignity with which the NPP members, in particular, conducted themselves.
 
The day recalls for me the pride that I continue to have in the sheer brilliance of the lawyers, led by Philip Addison, who argued so compellingly for the petitioners and who have now become famous for their deeds.

I said that day that everything in my bones, in the way I was brought up and in how I have conducted my life thus far, made it imperative that I accept a decision of the highest court of our land, even though I might disagree with it. I thank the Lord that He gave me that inner strength to display the leadership when required. As predicted, our reaction to the judgement was keenly watched and one hopes it set a precedent for the guidance of the rest of Africa.
 
If I have any regret, it is that the conditions in our country are worse than they were a year ago. Our economy is in a crisis, businesses are collapsing, the cost of living is unbearably high for the ordinary person, our youth remain without employment, our children are failing in their examinations, and we are experiencing strikes all over.
 
On that red-letter day a year ago, I said it was time for all of us to come together and work to find solutions for the many problems that we face. It was up to the President to seize the moment and offer the leadership to move the nation forward. Unfortunately, this has not been forthcoming.
 
Today, I am back in the hurly-burly of frontline politics and my enthusiasm is undiminished. I believe I can, in all humility, provide the leadership that is needed to get the NPP back into power and Ghana into prosperity if the NPP honours me again with the mandate to lead the party into the 2016 presidential election. 
 
Let us all together set our sights on the sun-lit horizons and prospects that await the Black Star of Africa when Ghana is again under good leadership.
 
God bless the wonderful people of Ghana!

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO APPEALS FOR CALM AND UNITY IN NPP
 
Like all well-meaning members of the New Patriotic Party, I have noticed with deep regret the events that took place today at our Party's Headquarters at the press conference addressed by the National Chairman of our party, Mr. Paul Afoko. It ended in unhappy and regretful incidents of violence.
 
I want to appeal to all NPP supporters and officials to remain calm and focused, and desist from actions that might undermine the unity of the party and compromise our chances for success in 2016. We are all members of one family and we should find a way to deal with our issues in a satisfactory manner.
 
I urge all NPP members to promote the things that bring us together and eschew those that seek to divide us. We must, always, be guided and guarded constantly by an uncompromising sense of unity, fellowship and greater purpose.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO READY FOR AUGUST 31 SPECIAL ELECTORAL COLLEGE

A faceless, email-based propaganda newswire that goes by the turgid name, ‘Ghana News’, emailed a story to media houses on Monday, August 18, bearing a false, sensational title 'Nana Akufo-Addo Runs Away From Super Delegates Conference'. This has been since published on www.ghanaweb.com.

According to the story, “Lawyer Owusu-Yeboah, who happens to be the Volta Regional Coordinator for Nana Akufo-Addo’s presidency [sic] bid has petitioned the party’s leadership to cancel the special delegates conference slated for 31 August, 2014.”

We write to state categorically that Nana Akufo-Addo has absolutely nothing to do with any petition, and, indeed,has no reason whatsoever to have anything to do with any petition that seeks to challenge the New Patriotic Party’s clearly laid down constitutional procedure on how a presidential candidate is elected for the Party. 

He is all in favour of the constitutional provision which calls for a Special Electoral College to shortlist the number of candidates to five and, as such, he is currently out there making a strong case to the delegates of this Special Electoral College for their votes.

So, it is not true that Akufo-Addo is running away from the August 31 race. In fact, to the contrary, he is rather looking forward to it. This story is purely mischievous. If, indeed, there are candidates out there who may wish to run away from the August 31 contest then Akufo-Addo is certainly not one of them.

It is also not true, as stated three times for effect in the ‘Ghana News’ story that Mr Owusu-Yeboah is the Volta Regional Coordinator for Nana Akufo-Addo’s campaign. 

Nana Akufo-Addo’s Campaign Coordinator for the Volta Region is Joseph Kwaku Nayan, former MP for Nkwanta North. This fact is widely known to NPP members in the Region, especially the Volta Regional and Constituency executives.

For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to emphasise that Nana Akufo-Addo has absolutely no reason to associate himself with the August 5, 2014 petition sent to the Party leadership, which is questioning the basis of the constitutional provision that calls for a Special Electoral College before the National Congress, scheduled for October 18, 2014.

It is not, and cannot be, the position of Akufo-Addo that the constitutional provision for a smaller Special Electoral College, where more than five candidates have filed to contest, is inconsistent with the provision that allows that shortlist of five to go before the much larger electoral college of the National Congress. 

Contrary to the propaganda in the ‘Ghana News’ story, we wish to assure people that Akufo-Addo is confident of his chances on both August 31 and October 18, 2014. He is out there doing what he needs to do, convincing as many delegates as he possibly can to vote for him, first on August 31 and October 18, to be the 2016 Presidential Candidate of the NPP.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Akufo-Addo rounds up voter registration monitoring exercise

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on Tuesday, August 12, rounded off his tour of some registration centres in the ongoing limited voter registration exercise with a visit to the Upper West Akim, Nsawam-Adoagyiri and Abuakwa South constituencies in the Eastern Region.

At Dobro, in the Nsawam-Adoagyiri constituency, Nana Akufo-Addo called on the Chief of the town, Nana Agyare II, as a mark of courtesy, before visiting the registration centre. This has been a key feature of Nana Akufo-Addo's tour in the regions he has so far visited in the monitoring exercise.

Nana Agyare II thanked Akufo-Addo for his visit to Dobro, a gesture he described as ""an honour to Dobro"".

""We need you, we desperately need you. The entire citizenry of Dobro are behind you. The hardships, rising cost of living and high levels of unemployment are too much for us to bear. Whatever we will do in 2016 to ensure that you win the election, we will do it. The youth of this town are all looking up to you to rescue them from mess the nation finds herself in,"" Nana Agyare said.

Re-echoing the sentiments of their Chief, hundreds of youth shouting ""Nana oo Nana"", ""Nana we need you"", ""No Nana, No Vote"", moved with Nana Akufo-Addo to the Dobro L/A primary school registration centre, the first centre he visited.

The NPP agents, at the centre, revealed that 6 minors had attempted registering at the centre that morning, but were prevented from doing so by the NPP agents and EC registration officials. This, according to them, was the only negative development at the centre since the commencement of the registration exercise.

At the Wesley Methodist Church registration centre, at Nsawam, Mr. Michael Berko, the NPP agent at the centre, told Nana that a total of 109 persons had been registered since August 3. Additionally, eligible voters had largely presented passports, drivers license and the national ID cards as proof of their eligibility.

The Densuso registration centre, at Adoagyiri, was the last centre visited in the constituency. But for the minor hitch of 14 registered voters who had not received their voter ID cards due to what EC officials describe as ""printer failure"", NPP agents and EC officials told Nana Addo that the process had been smooth.

Nana Akufo-Addo then proceeded to the Upper West Akim constituency, where he visited the Asuaba Presby Primary and Okurase L/A Primary registration centres. Just as he has done in all centres visited, Nana Addo thanked the NPP agents for the work they are doing for the party, and, in particular, reminded them to remain vigilant and ensure that only eligible voters find their names in the voter register ""in these last days.""

At the Okurase market, Nana Addo addressed residents and urged those who had still not registered to do so before the end of the exercise on Wednesday, August 13.

Acknowledging the difficult times Ghanaians are facing due to the bad governance of President Mahama and his administration, Akufo-Addo assured them of prosperity and progress when the NPP, with him as President, is returned into office in 2017.

Rounding off his tour of the region, Nana Akufo-Addo visited 3 registration centres in Akyem Asafo, Asiakwa and Kyebi, all in the Abuakwa South constituency.

At the Asafo Presby L/A primary registration centre, Akufo-Addo was informed that 140 odd people had registered. Likewise at the Asiakwa Supong and Kyebi Experimental registration centres polling agents and registration officials, they explained to Nana Akufo-Addo that the process had been smooth with no incidents having taken place.

Nana Akufo-Addo was accompanied on his tour by Kwasi Amoako-Atta, MP for Atiwa West; Frank Annoh-Dompreh, MP for Nsawam Adoagyiri; Samuel Atta Akyea, MP for Abuakwa South; Kiston Akomeng Kissi, Eastern Regional NPP Chairman; Alhaji Umar Bodinga, Eastern Regional NPP 1st Vice Chairman; Nana Fredua Ofori-Atta, Eastern Regional NPP 2nd Vice Chairperson; Kwame Appiah Kodua, Eastern Regional NPP Organiser; Jerry Osei-Poku, Eastern Regional NPP Youth Organiser; and some NPP constituency chairmen from the region.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"In the last few weeks, in my travels across the country, I've used the opportunity to have conversations with ordinary people on issues of public concern, including the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in some neighbouring countries. 

I have been disturbed by the lack of public education out there. There appears to be no comprehensive nationwide programme to give the people of Ghana proper information on Ebola. It is as if the work of public education has been left entirely to the mass media with no policy direction or deliberate support from Government.

Join me in urging Government to do a lot more to increase public education  about Ebola. It is imperative in preventing and containing this unprecedented outbreak. Prevention awareness education is the best cure.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has congratulated all polling agents of the New Patriotic Party for doing a good job in protecting the party's interests in the ongoing limited voter registration exercise, urging them to remain vigilant in the last few days of the exercise.
 
Akufo-Addo made this known when he toured 6 registration centres in the Agortime-Ziope, Adaklu, Central Tongu and Akatsi constituencies of the Volta Region on Sunday, as part of the monitoring exercise which has seen him visit so far a few registration centres in the Greater Accra and Central Regions.
 
Accompanied by Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, his running mate in the 2008 and 2012 elections; John Peter Amewu, Volta Regional NPP Chairman; Nii Adjiri Blankson, former Mayor of Accra; Elizabeth Ohene, former Minister of Education; regional NPP executives, and some constituency chairmen of the party in the region, the Afegame E.P. Primary registration centre, located in the border constituency of Agortime-Ziope, was the first centre visited by Akufo-Addo and his team.
 
Prior to visiting the registration centre, Nana Akufo-Addo paid a call on the Chief of Agortime Afegame, Nene Mawumasro XIV, as a mark of courtesy before proceeding to the registration centre in Agortime Ziope.
 
""The fact that you have travelled to Agortime to see us is very rare. We have been on the other side for a long time without any development or prosperity coming to us. We are going to make the change in 2016 and you will see the difference in the votes you will receive in 2016,"" Nene Mawumasro XIV assured Nana Akufo-Addo.
 
Witnessing at first hand, activities at this registration centre, some ten yards from the Togolese border, Nana Akufo-Addo took time to interact with polling agents of the party and EC registration officials.
 
The NPP polling agents told Nana Addo that ""registration has been slow"", as they have recorded a very low turnout since the start of the registration exercise. Newly elected voters confirmed their eligibility through two residents who already have their names in the voters' register, the registration officials told Nana Addo.
 
Akufo-Addo urged the NPP agents and EC officials to ensure that only eligible voters are registered in the 10-day exercise.
 
At Kpetoe, still in the Agortime Ziope constituency, Akufo-Addo called on Nene Noe Keteku III, the Chief of Agortime Kpetoe, who prayed to God for ""a new environment to engulf the nation in 2016.""
 
Akufo-Addo then proceeded to visit the Agortime SHS registration centre, where he appealed to the NPP agents to ensure that the number of new voters recorded in the log book, provided by the party, tallies with the number of voters registered by the Electoral Commission. Additionally, he urged the NPP polling agents to make it a point to demand, from the EC registration officials, a copy of the daily print out of registered voters.
 
Moving to the St. Anthony's Catholic Church registration centre in Adaklu Ahunda, in the Adaklu constituency, Mr. Paul Ege, the NPP polling agent, told Akufo-Addo that the process had been smooth, with only 23 persons registering at the centre since the commencement of the registration exercise.
The E.P Primary School registration centre located in Mafi-Kumase, and the Adidome District Assembly Hall registration centre, all in the Central Tongu constituency, were also visited by Akufo-Addo.
 
At the Pioneer Tobacco Company Hall registration centre in Akatsi, hundreds of residents poured into the registration centre upon learning of the arrival of Nana Akufo-Addo with shouts of ""Naa Nana, Naa Sho<U+0186>"" and ""No Nana No Vote"", a scene described by NPP regional executives as ""never seen before.""
 
Nana Akufo-Addo told the gathering that, ""Thus far, I have been to a few registration centres in the Greater Accra and Central Regions to monitor proceedings in the ongoing limited voter registration exercise. From what I have observed in the centres I have visited, the process appears to be proceeding smoothly.""
 
He continued, ""However, we cannot tell if this situation pertains to all the registration centres across the country. When the exercise is completed on August 13, that is when we can analyse reports from all parts of the country and determine whether or not the registration exercise was a success.""
 
Akufo-Addo also took the opportunity to thank all well-wishers across the country who, in diverse ways, have been helping NPP agents at the registration centres and feeding them as well. He pleaded with them to continue their good deeds until the end of the exercise.
 
The Eastern Region, on Tuesday, August 12, will be the last region to be toured by Nana Akufo-Addo, ahead of the August 14 resumption of his campaign for the flagbearership of the NPP.",2014-08-11T05:35:46+0000,status,NA,NA,649,115,28,792

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Turning to the International Monetary Fund, 8 years after Ghana under President Kufuor weaned itself off dependence on the IMF, is a clear admission of spectacular failure on the part of the John Mahama-led National Democratic Congress government.
 
It is the people of Ghana who are paying for President Mahama's mismanagement of the Ghanaian economy and the extensive corruption associated with his government. The hardships and austerity measures that will emerge from the programme will be borne by Ghanaians.
 
If, as a country, we have no choice but to fall on the IMF for a bailout, then we must have a good deal. The measures that will be put in place must do the following:

1. Protect and create jobs, because we need to tackle the widespread unemployment, affecting primarily the youth, that is bedevilling this nation.

2. Reduce the high cost of living that is affecting everybody.

3. Reduce the cost of doing business. At the moment, businesses are collapsing and the private sector is suffering. A booming private sector will mean a booming economy, which will, in its wake, create opportunities and employment for many in this country.

4. In the medium to long term, our main objective is the structural transformation of our economy. This IMF bailout should point in that direction, i.e. the modernisation of agriculture and the industrialisation of the country.
 
Ghanaians have to measure whatever package/agreement is reached with the IMF by these four criteria. Then we will know whether we have got a good deal or not.",2014-08-07T14:55:43+0000,status,NA,NA,1436,409,110,1955

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO VISITS REGISTRATION CENTRES IN CENTRAL REGION

After touring the Greater Accra Region on Monday to monitor the ongoing limited voter registration exercise, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo on Wednesday continued the monitoring exercise by visiting a few constituencies in the Central Region.

The brief tour of the Central Region saw Nana Akufo-Addo visit five registration centres in the Awutu Senya East, Gomoa East and Mfantseman constituencies.

At the Odupong-Kpehe/Kasoa Urban Council registration centre, located in Kasoa in the Awutu Senya East Constituency, polling agents of the New Patriotic Party told Akufo-Addo that the registration exercise had so far been smooth. According to them, 87 voters were registered on Monday, whilst 55 were registered on Tuesday.

Touring with Member of Parliament for the constituency, Hon. Hawa Koomson, and Hon. Kwamena Bartels, former MP for Ablekuma North, Nana Akufo-Addo then visited the Children's rainbow library registration centre. Just as was witnessed in his tour of Accra, the Supreme Court's declaration banning the use of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) card as one of the IDs proving identity and eligibility was being strictly adhered to. NPP agents at this centre explained that eligible voters either presented a drivers license or a passport to prove their eligibility.

Activity at both registration centres came to a standstill after residents learnt of Nana Akufo-Addo's presence in the constituency. Loud chants of ""Nana we are suffering, come and rescue us"", ""Nana we need you"", ""No Nana, No Vote"", ""No Nana, No Ghana"" followed the man tipped by many to emerge victorious in the October 18 presidential primary of the NPP.  

At the Gomoa East constituency, Akufo-Addo visited the Gomoa Buduburam Community Centre, where a registration centre had been set up. He was told by the NPP agents that most first time voters had come with two voters to validate their eligibility before they were allowed to register.

Moving on to the Mfantseman constituency, Nana Akufo-Addo first visited the Ebenezer Methodist Church registration centre, at Mankessim, where 56 voters were registered yesterday, and, as at 1:00pm when Nana Akufo-Addo arrived, a total of 26 voters had been registered. The Akuada-Anafo registration centre at Saltpond, also in the Mfantseman constituency, was the final registration centre visited by Nana Akufo-Addo.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO MARKS 67TH ANNIVERSARY OF U.G.C.C. FORMATION
 
August 4 is a special day in the history of our country. On August 4, 1897, we witnessed the establishment in Cape Coast of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society by the great Ghanaian patriots, John Mensah Sarbah, Joseph Casely Hayford and others, which successfully fought the British colonial power to maintain indigenous control of our lands.
 
On the same day, 50 years later, at Saltpond, the great nationalists of the time, George Alfred “Paa” Grant, J B Danquah, Francis Awoonor-Williams, R S Blay, George More, R S Wood, J W de Graft Johnson, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey, Ebenezer Ako Adjei, William Ofori-Atta, Edward Akufo-Addo, and Cobbina Kessie, together with paramount chiefs, clergymen, lawyers, entrepreneurs, teachers, traders and men and women from all walks of life in the Gold Coast gathered to inaugurate the United Gold Coast Convention, UGCC of blessed memory, the first political party of the Gold Coast, formed to spearhead the fight for national independence.
 
Thus began the final phase of our struggle for freedom and independence. All the subsequent events which followed - the 1948 riots in Accra, the establishment of the Watson Commission, the formation of the Convention People's Party, the setting up of the Coussey Constitutional Committee - flowed from the activities of that day.
 
We must continue to honour this day, and the men and women  who participated in these historic events which led to our national independence.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO MONITORS REGISTRATION EXERCISE IN ACCRA

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on Monday, August 4, at the commencement of the limited voter registration exercise, toured a few constituencies in the Greater Accra Region to monitor the exercise.

The UCOMS registration centre, at the Bortianor-Ngleshie Amanfro constituency, was Akufo-Addo's first point of call. There, he interacted with registration officials, polling agents of the New Patriotic Party and eligible voters, who were in the queue waiting for their turn to be registered. He was joined by Hon. Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, MP for Anyaa Sowutuom, who has oversight responsibility for the ""orphan"" Bortianor-Ngleshie Amanfro constituency.

Akufo-Addo urged agents of the NPP at the polling station to remain vigilant and ensure that only eligible voters are registered, re-echoing sentiments made in Wa, when he announced the suspension of his campaign, that ""winning 2016 starts from now, as a credible voters' register is the key to fostering confidence in our electoral process"".

Nana Akufo-Addo's next point of call was the Madina constituency, where he visited the Moral International registration centre, located within the premises of the Madina Divisional Police Headquarters.

Whilst observing the processes being undertaken by the registration officials, market women and NPP sympathisers, who learnt of Akufo-Addo's presence, thronged the Police Station, filling it within a matter of seconds, with chants of ""No Nana, No Vote"" and ""2016 is your time.""

The Dodowa Post Office registration centre and the Dodowa Newtown ICCES Centre, all in the Shai Osoduku constituency, were the registration centres toured by Nana Akufo-Addo in that constituency. Here again, a large crowd quickly assembled at the registration centre to encourage him ahead of the NPP's presidential primary.

Akufo-Addo also toured the Adentan constituency, where he visited the Amrahia JHS registration centre. Polling agents and registration officials told Nana Akufo-Addo that a total of 39 new voters had so far been registered. The registration officials and NPP polling agents told him that the process had been smooth, with no hitches recorded. He met Rt. Rev. Asante-Antwi there, who was also monitoring the process. Another large crowd came to hail him.

The tour of Greater Accra ended with a visit to the Dunia Cinema registration centre, at Nima, in the Ayawaso North constituency, where he resides. Predictably, there was a great deal of excitement in the large crowd at his presence at the Cinema.

It was good to see that, in all the registration centres visited on the day, the Supreme Court's ruling, which barred the use of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) card from being used as one of the IDs for proving a voter's identity and eligibility, was strictly being adhered to by registration officials, polling agents and voters alike.

Nana Akufo-Addo, in the coming days, will tour registration centres in the Central, Volta and Eastern regions as part of the monitoring exercise.

Accompanying him on Monday's tour was Hon. Henry Quartey, MP for Ayawaso Central; Stanley Nii Adjiri Blankson, former Mayor of Accra; Archibald Cobbina, Greater Accra NPP Regional Organiser; Joyce Zempare, Greater Accra NPP Regional Women's Organiser; Alhaji Aminu Abu, Greater Accra NPP Regional Nasara Co-ordinator; Francis Asenso-Boakye, Political Assistant; and Eugene Arhin, Press Secretary.",2014-08-04T19:43:23+0000,status,NA,NA,481,79,19,579

No electricity, we oil pressure reading low
Shall we abandon ship
Or shall we stay on it and perish slow”

I will stay on this ship, the NPP will stay on this ship and we shall get it to refloat. We shall restore hope and we shall make Ghana work again and bring back the smile to the faces of our people. The Black Star will shine again!
To the people of Ghana I say, keep hope alive. I believe in Ghana. And, above all, I believe in God. Change will come in 2016. I am ready. Let the journey begin.

With an old captain named Eric Williams
For years sailed smooth and free

With wealth that few surpass
And in her day she sailed majestically
There were few in her class

Nana Akufo-Addo completed his tour of the three Northern regions, Friday evening, with all eleven constituency chairmen in the region declaring their unflinching support for his bid to lead the New Patriotic Party into the December 2016 elections.
 
Not wanting to be outdone by their colleagues from the Northern and Upper East Regions, all eleven Chairmen, individually, declared Nana Akufo-Addo to be the only candidate who can deliver victory for the NPP in 2016.
 
According to the Chairmen, the consensus from grassroots of the party is what has informed their decision to back Nana Akufo-Addo.
 
In addition, the constituency chairmen explained that Akufo-Addo's decision to accept the verdict handed down by the Supreme Court in the election petition, without seeking a review, has endeared him to many Ghanaians. 
 
""They now see you (Akufo-Addo) as a man who has the well-being of the nation at heart is not after his own selfish interests. You put the peace and stability of the nation ahead of your own interests, and because of this, Ghanaians say they will vote for you if we present you again in 2016. They tell us that 'no nana, no vote'. So why should we bring someone else?"" Ibrahim Braimah Wikana, Chairman for Lambussie told the pack gathering of delegates at the GNAT Hall in Wa.
 
Chairmen from Daffiama/Bussie/Issa, Lambussie, Nadowli Kaleo, Nandom, Sissala East, Sissala West, Wa Central, Wa East, Wa West, Lawra, Jirapa assured Nana Akufo-Addo that ""if the Northern Region is pledging to give you 100% support, we will give you 120% support.""

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"I AM FOR 'ONE GHANA', AKUFO-ADDO DECLARES

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has assured the nation that a government under his leadership will be committed to building a society of opportunities for all, as it is the path to ensuring progress and prosperity in Ghana.

""I am committed to One Ghana"", Nana Akufo-Addo declared, adding that two burning ambitions fueling his drive to lead this country are ""the future  cohesion and unity of Ghana, and secondly, ensuring that the development gap between the North and South is bridged.""

Akufo-Addo made this known when he rounded up his tour of the Upper West Region, on Friday evening, addressing a packed hall of delegates at the GNAT Hall, Wa.

According to Nana Akufo-Addo, the cause of Ghana's current predicament is bad leadership, as Ghanaians have lost faith in the ability of President Mahama and his National Democratic Congress government.

""What Ghana is looking for is a competent and experienced team, under a decisive leader to put Ghana back on track. Ghanaians want a good government. God willing and with the people of Ghana consenting, I can assemble such a formidable team that will make Ghana work again,"" Nana Addo noted.

Touching on the ""sad SADA story"", Nana Akufo-Addo recalled how then vice presidential candidate of the NDC, in 2008, and now President Mahama, bastardised him when he advocated the setting up of the Northern Development Authority (NoDA), referring to Akufo-Addo's vision as ""pipe dreams.""

""Then candidate Mahama said I was talking from the back of my head and if I could raise $1 billion for NoDA, I should use that money to pay the VRA debt,"" Nana Addo recounted.

He continued, ""NDC, as always, saw the strength of our argument. They then changed the name and called it Savannah Accelerated Development Authority. To avoid being accused of copying, they included the northern parts of the Brong Ahafo and Volta regions.""

Nana Akufo-Addo stressed that SADA has become ""one of the biggest tragedies of modern Ghana"", adding that ""it has become a vehicle of widespread corruption and theft of state property.""

He assured the delegates that the modernisation and transformation of the North is an important vision of his, and will come into fruition when he is given the mandate by Ghanaians to lead the country.

Akufo-Addo reiterated his commitment to serving the Ghanaian people, and ensuring the wellbeing of the Ghanaian is uplifted, stressing that ""I am not in politics to make money for myself or to enrich myself.""",2014-08-02T13:04:05+0000,status,NA,NA,955,173,58,1186

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has briefly suspended his campaign for the flagbearership of the New Patriotic Party to enable him and Party officers in the various regions monitor the limited voter registration exercise scheduled to take place from August 4 to August 13, 2014.

Addressing delegates of the New Patriotic Party in Wa, as part of his campaign tour of the region, Nana Akufo-Addo told delegates on Friday that he had decided to suspend his campaign ""to show you how seriously I am taking this exercise"", adding that ""winning election 2016 starts now.""

""I believe all of you here will be playing a leading role in our Party's efforts to monitor the registration exercise. I will urge you to be vigilant and take this exercise seriously,"" he said.

The suspension of his campaign, according to Nana Addo, is for two main reasons.

""Firstly, to allow you, in the regions, constituencies and polling stations to concentrate all your attention on this registration exercise. Secondly, I also want to get involved in going around to assist in the monitoring of the exercise,"" he added, to a rapturous applause from the delegates.

Nana Addo also sent a clarion call to all NPP officials, all NPP members and sympathisers, and all patriotic Ghanaians to assist in making the registration exercise a complete success.

""Let us all assist the Party's agents in whichever way that we can to help them succeed in this 10 day exercise. If you can contribute in the Party's efforts to monitor, please do so. And let me repeat, winning 2016 begins from now,"" he concluded.

Nana Akufo-Addo's campaign will resume on August 14, the day after the registration exercise ends, with the Eastern Region being his next point of call.",2014-08-01T18:53:33+0000,status,NA,NA,535,81,19,635

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO SUSPENDS CAMPAIGN AHEAD OF LIMITED VOTER REGISTRATION EXERCISE

Ahead of the August 4 to August 13, 2014 limited registration exercise of new and eligible voters  as announced by the Electoral Commission, Nana Akufo-Addo has suspended his campaign for the flagbearership of the New Patriotic Party within this period.

This is to enable polling station, constituency and regional party executives remain focused ahead of this exercise. Despite the legitimate concerns raised by Nana Akufo-Addo about the credibility of our current voters' register, the suspension of the campaign, nonetheless, is to enable party executives across the country prepare and remain vigilant during the registration period, so as to ensure that only eligible voters get their names onto the electoral register.

Nana Akufo-Addo was scheduled to be in the Brong Ahafo, Ashanti, Eastern and Volta regions from August 3 to August 10. Campaigning in these regions have, therefore, been rescheduled and the new dates communicated to the regions.

Nana Akufo-Addo's campaign will resume on August 14, ahead of the Special Electoral College scheduled to take place on August 31, with the Eastern Region being the first point of call.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"NORTHERN REGIONAL NPP CHAIRMEN ENDORSE NANA AKUFO-ADDO

Ahead of the Special Electoral College of the New Patriotic Party scheduled to take place on August 31 and October 18 presidential primary, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has been assured of receiving all 31 votes of constituency chairmen in the region.

The endorsement of Nana Akufo-Addo's bid by all 31 chairmen took place at the Radach Memorial Hall in Tamale, when he took his campaign to the Northern Region in his bid to be elected presidential candidate of the Party for the 2016 election.

Reading from a prepared statement, the Northern Region Chairpersons Association (NORCA), explained that their decision to ""declare our unflinching support for Nana Akufo-Addo"" and ""back no one but Nana Akufo-Addo"" was borne out of the fact that he is the best candidate to wrestle power from the ruling National Democratic Congress. 

According Mr. Fuseini Nurudeen, Chairman of the Nalerigu Constituency, who read the statement on behalf of the group, Nana Akufo-Addo ""has undergone so many trials and proven to be a true Party faithful over the years.""

They further indicated that Akufo-Addo has been loyal and faithful to the NPP and all of its functionaries even in ""hard times.""

""He has never dreamt of leaving the Party for any reason be it good or adverse. He has proven to all and sundry that Ghana matters more than any other individual, as the Supreme Court verdict is a critical example,"" they ended.

Additionally, they explained that their decision was taken due to widespread consultations they had with their grassroots who want nobody but Nana Akufo-Addo to lead the party to victory in 2016. 

The Chairpersons who signed the ""declaration sheet"" were from the following 31 constituencies in the Northern Region: Tamale South, Tamale Central, Bimbilla, Yendi, Nalerigu, Walewale, Sagnarigu, Tolon, Yapei-Kusawgu, Kpandai, Gushiegu, Savelugu, Salaga South, Sawla-Tuna-Kalba, Kumbungu, Karaga and Tamale North, Wulensi, Bunkpurugu, Bole/Bamboi, Mion, Saboba, Zabzugu, Tatale, Chereponi, Nanton, Damango, Daboya, Yagaba-Kubori, Yunyoo, and Salaga North. 

Thus far, the total number of votes pledged by delegates in the Upper East and Northern Regions to Nana Akufo-Addo ahead of the Special Electoral College, currently stands at 105 - 68 delegates from Northern Region and 37 delegates from the Upper East Region.",2014-07-31T20:29:25+0000,status,NA,NA,699,101,31,831
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Akufo-Addo calls for audit of voters' register

""Our message to Dr Afari Gyan and the Electoral Commission is simple: we need a register that truly represents those who are entitled to vote in Ghana. The current register is bogus. We are not interested in playing the blame game. We are only interested in doing what is right for our democracy. Let us all work together on this. Ghanaian elections should not be West African election.""

These were the words of Nana Akufo-Addo when he addressed the delegates of the New Patriotic Party at the Radach Memorial Hall, in Tamale, ahead of the Special Electoral College and presidential primary of the Party. 

As a first step before the District Assembly election, Akufo-Addo called on the Electoral Commission to heed to the calls of civil society and political parties (including PPP, PNC, CPP and NPP) to allow for an independent, forensic audit of the existing biometric voters register.

""I am told the entire process, from the opening of competitive international bids to the completion of the forensic biometric audit, could take up to a couple of months. This first step can be taken before the next District Assembly Election. To do this will send a strong signal to the country that the Electoral Commission is sincere and serious on the question of electoral reforms. Let the audit of the current register serve as a key step to restoring public confidence in our electoral system. It is an important decision that we have to take to consolidate our democracy,"" Nana Akufo-Addo stated.

Nana Akufo-Addo made these comments on the back of Wednesday's ruling by the Supreme Court, which stated prohibited the EC from allowing the use of the National Health Insurance cards for the  voters' registration exercise.

He congratulated the plaintiffs, Abu Ramadan, Evans Nimako, and Kwasi Danso Acheampong, for their patriotism, and also congratulated the Supreme Court, under the leadership of the Chief Justice, for their decision.

The process for electoral reforms, according to Nana Addo, has started with this decision by the Supreme Court.

""That decision means sorting out the voters' register, the base document for elections, is the first major step. My message to you here and to all Ghanaians is that we cannot compromise on our push to get electoral reforms. We must do it and do it well to protect our democracy,"" he maintained.

On the announcement made by the EC regarding the setting of a new date for the limited registration exercise - from Monday, August 4 to August 13, Nana Akufo-Addo said this has to be done, as the Constitution requires, before the next public election, the District Assembly election.

However, Nana Addo indicated that this move will amount to adding more names to a register that is already discredited. He urged to listen to the growing calls for a credible register and do what is required to achieve that.",2014-07-31T17:03:02+0000,status,NA,NA,1095,254,65,1414

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"I will deliver victory in 2016, Akufo-Addo assures delegates

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has assured delegates of the New Patriotic Party that nothing short of victory will be the portion of the Party in the 2016 elections when he is elected presidential candidate at the October 18 presidential primary.

Addressing a packed hall of delegates from the Upper East region at the Bolgatanga Secondary Technical School on Wednesday, Akufo-Addo told delegates that proceedings from the presidential election petition had showed that the battle for victory in 2016 must be won at the polling station.

""Give me another chance, elect me again. The action before the Supreme Court showed one thing. They told us that the battle for winning elections is at the polling station. That is where our energies, resources and strategies will go. If we learn our lesson and block the loopholes identified, I am confident that the Almighty God and the people of Ghana will listen to our plea and a declaration will be made in December 2016 that the NPP's presidential candidate, Nana Akufo-Addo, has won the election and is the President-Elect of Ghana,"" Nana Addo stressed to the delight of the delegates.

On propaganda being embarked on by some persons, both within and outside of the NPP that he was old and not fit, Nana Akufo-Addo responded by saying ""I am being told that I am too old to be President"", to which the delegates retorted, ""No, we disagree"".

He recounted how ""one man, two years older than me in Cote d'Ivoire"" is putting to shame the work of the ""so-called young man here in Ghana"", a reference to the stunning developmental record chalked by 72-year old President Alassane Ouattara in war-ravaged Cote d'Ivoire in some 2½ years.

""Give me the chance to do the same for Ghana and bring Ghana back onto the path of prosperity and a good life for all citizens. If I wasn't fit and ready for the task ahead, I wouldn't be putting myself up for the task,"" Nana Addo reiterated.

On the abysmal performance of President Mahama and his NDC government, Nana Addo stressed that the ""Better Ghana agenda has collapsed and lies in ruins."" 

He explained that Ghanaians are saddled with high fuel prices, utility tariff hikes and a general high increase in the cost of living.

""Everything is so high, and yet our pockets are so low,"" Nana Addo stated.

Akufo-Addo noted that all the gains made in the 8 year period of the NPP under the leadership of President J.A Kufuor have all been whittled down under President Mahama and his NDC government. He explained that, for example, the whole of 2014 is yet to see any payments being made into the GETFund, National Health Insurance Scheme or the District Assemblies Common Fund for the Upper East Region. He appealed to the President to rectify this situation immediately so that social services in the Upper East Region can be delivered. 

""I am in politics to bring this country forward, not for personal gain. The world knows Ghana's potential, and I am saying that, together, we can make the Black Star shine again,"" Akufo-Addo added.

Nana Akufo-Addo challenged the Mahama administration to fulfill its promise of constructing a modernised market for the people of Bolgatanga, adding that ""I went to see the Bolgatanga market and it was distressing.""",2014-07-31T07:34:18+0000,status,NA,NA,823,139,45,1007

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on Wednesday, joined residents of Wungu, in the Walewale constituency in the Northern region, in mourning the passing of the late Jacob Yidana.
The late Jacob Yidana, who retired as a Police Commissioner, died on Tuesday 22nd July, 2014 and was buried in his home town, Wungu.

Jacob Yidana was the police officer who investigated the gruesome murder of the 3 High Court Judges in 1982. He subsequently wrote a book titled ""Who killed the Judges?"", an act which subsequently resulted in him serving a prison term of 9 years.

Present at the ceremony were Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, 2008 and 2012 running mate to Nana Akufo-Addo; Hon. Mahami Salifu, former Upper East Regional Minister, Hon. Ambrose Dery, former Upper West Regional Minister and former MP for Lawra Nandom; Hon. Dominic Nitiwul, Deputy Minority Leader and MP for Bimbilla; Daniel Bugri Nabu, Northern Regional NPP Chairman; and the MP of Walewale, Hon. Dr. Sagre Bambani.

Nana Addo in paying tribute to the late Yidana explained that he was on his way to meet delegates of the New Patriotic Party in Bolgatanga, but deemed it fit to grace the funeral ceremony of  ""a well respected police officer, who left a very good reputation behind"".

Akufo-Addo further indicated that the late Jacob Yidana was ""a man who deserves all the honour that is being accorded him"" on his passing. He urged the family to stay strong in these difficult times and expressed his deepest condolences to them as well. 

The family of the late Jacob Yidana, in return, also expressed their gratitude to Nana Akufo-Addo for his show of brotherliness and presented him with a ram and 6 guinea fowls. 

Whilst in the village, Nana Addo also paid a courtesy call on Nazoori Saka Suleimana, the Chief of Wungu. He encouraged Nana Akufo-Addo to persevere as victory is not so far away from him.",2014-07-31T07:24:58+0000,status,NA,NA,539,52,14,605
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""Akufo-Addo is our best hope for victory in 2016"" - Upper East delegates declare

Delegates in the Upper East Region have unanimously declared their total support for Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo's bid to lead the New Patriotic Party into the 2016 general elections.

All 37 delegates who will vote in the August 31 Special Electoral College, as well as over 500 delegates made this declaration at the Assembly Hall of the Bolgatanga Secondary Technical School, when Nana Akufo-Addo arrived in the region to campaign. 

When asked by Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, who was addressing delegates,  to indicate by the show of hands the number of delegates who will vote for Nana Akufo-Addo, the delegates leapt from their seats with spontaneous cheers of ""Nana oo Nana"", indicating a 100% support for Nana Akufo-Addo.

After Nana Akufo-Addo had spoken, all constituency chairmen in the region who were present demanded to have a word with Nana Akufo-Addo, in the full glare of delegates. 

Each and every constituency chairman, beginning with Mr. David Amoabi Afoko, Chairman for Builsa North and brother of NPP National Chairman, Mr. Paul Afoko, then, individually endorsed the candidature of Nana Akufo-Addo.

The Chairmen present were from all 15 constituencies -- Nabdam, Chiana Paga, Bolgatanga Central, Garu, Navrongo Central, Bawku Central, Pusiga, Bongo, Zebilla, Binduri, Talensi, Builsa North, Tempane, Builsa South and Bolgatanga East.

They indicated that all constituency executives in their region are poised to deliver a resounding victory for Nana Akufo-Addo in the Upper East Region, as they believe they he is the Party's best hope for victory in 2016.

The Regional Chairman of the Party, Adams Mahama, after the declaration by his constituency chairmen, also declared his support for Nana Akufo-Addo by stating that ""I don't want money, I want the people. I want the choice of the people who is Nana Akufo-Addo,"" the Chairman said.

Former regional chairmen, District Chief Executives, Ministers and Members of Parliament, some of whom are delegates of the party, also declared unflinching support for Nana Addo. 

The included Hon. Agyeskia Agambila, Hon. Leo Kalba, Hon. Kofi Ada, and Hon. Boniface Gambilla.

""We have been with Nana in the trenches through all the years. Having known his ability, capacity and experience, we have come to one conclusion, that he is the one and only person to lead the NPP into 2016,"" Hon. Leo Kaba, former MP for Chiana Paga, the representative of the group, stated.

Hon. Dominic Nitiwul, Deputy Minority Leader, who also spoke at the event, indicated that all 12 NPP Members of Parliament from the three northern regions had resolved to vote and campaign for Nana Akufo-Addo to win the 2014 NPP primary and subsequently the 2016 general election. He further indicated that all 3 NPP Regional Chairmen from the North were also of the same mind.

He indicated that the NPP ""does not have the time to elect a new candidate for 2016 as Ghanaians say it is Nana Akufo-Addo they want.""

He appealed to the 37 delegates in the upcoming Special Electoral College to vote for Nana as ""he has been very faithful to the NPP, more so in his choice of Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia in 2008 and still keeping faith in him till date"". 

Hon. Dominic Nitiwul recounted how the 3 NPP Northern Regional Chairmen in the year 2000 at the time, in the same manner, threw their support behind J.A Kufuor.  With the same scenario panning out in 2014, Dominic Nitiwul indicated that this bodes well for Nana Akufo-Addo's fortunes in 2016.

The 2012 campaign manager of the NPP's presidential campaign, Boakye Agyarko, taking his turn to address the delegates, indicated that the clarion call across the nation is ""No Nana, No Vote"".

""We are lucky in the NPP that we have a product. The people in the market are telling us that bring that product and we will buy it. But some people are trying to confuse you. They are telling you to bring a new product onto the market, which the people in the market do not know. Will you bring that new product?"" Boakye Agyarko asked, to which the answer from the delegates was a resounding ""No.""

""It is not about age, it is about wisdom, a sharp mind, courage and a good heart. Nana Akufo-Addo will be one of the best people that this country can ever get to lead it,"" he added.

On the claim by some presidential aspirants in the NPP to being able to win over floating voters, he asked ""How do you want to be President, when your own people don't want you? Win your base first and we can then be confident that you will win floating voters.""

""Every time that we need someone to stand up for this Party, show courage and listen to your problems, you can count on Nana Akufo-Addo. If the court records and pink sheets show that we won election 2012, there is no need taking a step backwards. I recommend Nana Akufo-Addo as the best bet for 2016.

Traders at the Makola, Kantamanto and Okaishie markets have hailed Nana Akufo-Addo and Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia as ""prophets"", as the warnings they proffered regarding the consequences of voting for the National Democratic Congress have all come to pass.
 
Carrying stones of all shapes and sizes on their heads, market women, particularly, were heard singing and calling on Nana Akufo-Addo and Dr. Bawumia to, literally, ""come for their stones"" since the era of John Mahama's ""bad governance"" has vindicated the pair.
 
""Everything Nana Addo said about the deterioration of life under the NDC, during the 2012 electioneering campaign period, has been proven to be true. We regret voting for the NDC because they have made life so unbearable for us,"" Ama Serwaa, a trader was heard saying.
 
According to them, the hardships imposed on them by the incompetence of the John Mahama government has never been witnessed in this country as every sector of the country's economy is in a downward spiral.
 
They complained of the rising cost of living, the widespread corruption which eating away the very fabric of national life, no money as well as rising unemployment. All these, according to them, is presenting a bleak and hopeless future for generations yet to come.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo, on his part assured the thousands of market women that 2016 presented an opportunity to Ghanaians to vote the NPP back into office so as to continue outstanding work done by the J.A. Kufuor government from 2001 to 2008.
 
""We will put Ghana back to work. We will stabilize the cedi; we have done it before. We will manage the economy competently; we have done it before. We will create the environment for the private sector to thrive; we have done it before. We will provide the leadership that will mobilise the positive energies of the great majority of Ghanaians, irrespective of their political affiliations, to take the bold steps towards the structural transformation of our national economy, which is the way to lasting prosperity,"" Nana Addo noted.
 
He continued, ""We will improve significantly the governance of our nation, we have done it before. I am strong in my conviction and confident that we can do it. I know we are capable. God did not put us on this rich land to be poor. It is bad leadership that makes us poor.""",2014-07-29T21:10:50+0000,status,NA,NA,1482,371,109,1962
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"SPEECH DELIVERED BY NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO AT THE LAUNCH OF HIS 2014 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY CAMPAIGN AT AKWEI'S HOUSE, AKOTO LANTE, ON 29TH JULY 2014 AT 11:00AM

Good morning and welcome. I'm honoured that you have all come to join me begin my campaign to lead our great party into the 2016 general elections at this famous venue - Akwei's house. This house evokes a lot of emotion and fond memories in me. Born as I was, in Swalaba, not so far from here, I know the significant role Akwei's House has played in the history of our nation. Many of the great figures of the United Party, from which today's NPP descends, used to meet here regularly in the late 1950s. Persons like Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey, Ashie Nikoi, Attoh Okine, K.Y. Attoh, Henry Thompson and the young Attoh Quarshie -- all of whom were victims, indeed among the first, of the infamous Preventive Detention Act -- were frequent visitors, coming here to interact with their supporters, and charting their determination to resist the incipient dictatorship of Kwame Nkrumah's CPP. They were determined to hold aloft the banner of liberty, and were prepared to pay the price for so doing. Even though initially it appeared they had failed, history has subsequently vindicated them. They were the pioneers in the construction of the multi-party democratic Ghana that we are enjoying today. We have to emulate their determination as we begin the difficult task of returning the NPP back into power, and restoring Ghana onto the path of progress and prosperity once again.

In our quest to wrestle power from the incompetent hands of John Mahama, our party, over the last 7 months, has held elections from polling station, constituency, regional, right up to the national level, and in the process elected some 140,000 executives and officers to steer the affairs of the party for the next four years. The generally peaceful, free, fair and united manner in which the polls were conducted serve as an encouraging testimony to the NPP's democratic culture and a neat exhibition of the spirit of oneness that the NPP needs. This must and will continue. We are now at the final hurdle in these internal contests, and we must consciously let peace and unity within the NPP serve as our constant guide.

On my part, I continue to be humbled by the confidence that many, many Ghanaians from all walks of life, especially young people, some of whom are yet to cast their first ballot, have in me. I am profoundly grateful that so many people consider me worthy to lead this promising nation of ours, even at the young age of 70. I do not know what 70-year olds are supposed to feel like but I feel well, my body is in good shape; my mind remains as sharp as it ever was. I am constantly grateful to the Almighty that I have been so blessed. I have questioned and examined myself intensely to be sure that, to borrow a phrase, the competitive fire still burns in my belly. Ladies and gentlemen I am fit and ready and my appetite is as keen as ever to go into battle for the cause of the NPP.

I wish to assure all of you gathered here, that, contrary to the propaganda out there, Nana Akufo-Addo is emotionally, intellectually, psychologically, physically, patriotically and spiritually strong enough to lead this party and our dear nation Ghana.

In the 8 years of NPP administration under the outstanding leadership of President J A Kufuor, through our policies in education, health, youth employment, small loan schemes, to name a few, we demonstrated in practical terms our belief that government has a responsibility to provide all its citizens with skills and opportunities to create their own wealth. As a party, we have always sought to create a political economy consistent with our fundamental belief in individual liberties; provide equal opportunities to all citizens; promote and empower the private sector, so as to create wealth, and use the tax revenue accrued to the state from such free entrepreneurship to develop infrastructure and invest in the social sectors to create greater opportunities for the less well off.

It is obvious to us all now that these programmes and ideas can only be implemented under an NPP government. The NPP has unfinished business. Ghanaians are impatient for the NPP to finish its internal contest and focus on what matters most; the restoration of hope and the development of our nation.

From what I hear on the ground, from the endorsements and declarations of support for my candidature, both publicly and privately, I believe in all humility that I am the party's best bet to winning power in 2016. The journey to 2016, the journey to maintain the confidence of the great majority of Ghanaians for the NPP, secure that victory, and begin the all-important project to rescue Ghana and get Ghana working again has started. Ghana is not working. Ghana should work again. And, with me and the NPP, with you the people and with God on our side, Ghana will work again!

I urge all my fellow aspirants and supporters to be mindful of the fact that the people of Ghana are looking up to us so to conduct our affairs as to give them the confidence to trust us with the mandate to serve them once again. Ghanaians are looking to the NPP to restore hope and offer the kind of purposeful leadership that will speed up the development of our nation and the prosperity of every Ghanaian. On my part, I have always mounted a clean campaign and have always focused on issues. Nothing shall sway me from this path, because this is but a contest between members of one family, the Great Elephant family.

We have to focus on the havoc Mahama's government is wreaking on the populace on a daily basis. We are two years in the second term of the NDC. The Better Ghana they promised in 2008 and repeated in 2012 remains an empty and cynical slogan as is their “e dey bii keke”. There can be no Better Ghana when access to healthcare is worse today than it was even a year ago. There can be no better Ghana, when our cedi is the worst performing currency in Africa and the second worst in the world, better only than Ukraine's local currency. There can be no better Ghana when higher taxes, high utility prices, high fuel prices, low sales are killing businesses up and down the country. There can be no better Ghana when our young people cannot find jobs.  There can be no better Ghana when the leadership of the country has lost touch with the concerns of the people and dances to the tune of “Yen tie obiaa”. There can be no better Ghana so long as the NDC remains in power. There can be no better Ghana with the current clueless and uncaring leadership.

The crisis facing our country can be cured. But it can only be cured by a competent and dynamic team with a programme for determined implementation under the decisive leadership of a person with a clear vision of Ghana's future. At the heart of the crisis Ghana is facing is a crisis of confidence in leadership. The people have lost confidence in President Mahama and the NDC’s ability to govern. This is clearly evident in the unprecedented nationwide demonstrations that have rocked this country, recently by the Trades Union Congress, the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union, health workers, workers in our educational institutions, railway workers, residents in some communities in Accra and other parts of the country protesting against the harsh conditions of life, including the poor condition of roads in their areas. It is this same loss of confidence in the leadership that led to the disgraceful spectacle of Ghana flying money halfway across the world to pay a mutinous national team.

It gives me no pleasure to say that things are unfolding just as we had predicted, and that, indeed, the chickens have come home to roost. The hole this country is in is a result of the desperation of the NDC government to win the 2012 elections at all cost. The reckless overspending which resulted in a budget deficit of GH¢8.7 billion representing 12.1% of GDP, the widespread corruption, the payment of millions and millions of Ghana cedis of our money in dubious judgement debts, the disregard of value for money in the award of contracts is what has brought Ghana down on its knees. It gives pain to watch the NDC display such utter incompetence and fail so abjectly to fix the mess it has put us in.

There are some who are expressing loud anxieties that Ghana might be heading back to the dark days because of the chaos, economic meltdown and blatant corruption we are experiencing. Ladies and gentlemen, there is one critical difference today. That is, we have a democracy and an elected government; all our institutions might not be working as well as we would like, but we have a strong national consensus on multi-party democracy being the way to govern. Our regime change comes and will come in December 2016 when we vote out this clueless and uncaring government. That might seem a long way off for many who are currently enduring the difficulties and hardships, but I urge you all to keep hope alive. We turn our back on our democracy at our peril.

In the meantime, we will continue to urge President Mahama to listen to the advice of many well-meaning Ghanaians and make the lives of our people easier. For example, the Minority in Parliament deserves to be heard on the subject of reckless and dubious loans. For the moment we shall keep on praying for our President at the minimum to keep our nation together, and to alleviate the suffering of our people.

My vision and determination to transform Ghana remains as strong as it ever was. There is an even greater urgency now to give Ghana the leadership it deserves, the leadership that can bring back confidence to our country. The soul of our nation is in pain. Our people are in pain. The international community is puzzled; how did Ghana get itself into this mess within such a short period. Investors are worried. Parents are in tears. Children fear for their future. Workers are worried and unhappy. 

We will put Ghana back to work. We will stabilize the cedi, we have done it before. We will manage the economy competently, we have done it before. We will create the environment for the private sector to thrive, we have done it before. We will provide the leadership that will mobilise the positive energies of the great majority of Ghanaians, irrespective of their political affiliations, to take the bold steps towards the structural transformation of our national economy, which is the way to lasting prosperity. We will improve significantly the governance of our nation, we have done it before. I am strong in my conviction and confident that we can do it. I know we are capable. God did not put us on this rich land to be poor. It is bad leadership that makes us poor.

God-willing, I will from tomorrow embark on a nationwide tour ahead of the holding of the Special Electoral College, fixed by the party's National Council for 31st August 2014. I will travel to Bolgatanga, Tamale, Wa the next three days, and to all parts of the country to plead with delegates to give me the mandate to lead the NPP once again. 2016 is and must be the time to rescue Ghana.

I have established a campaign structure in the constituencies, in the regions and across the nation to help me run an effective campaign.

The President of the Republic said at the Eid-ul Fitr celebration in Kumasi yesterday that he was the captain of the ship of state. This brings to mind an old Trinidadian calypso song of the 1970s, called Gypsy, whose words are apt for today's Ghana:

""Captain this ship is sinking

Captain these seas are rough, oh yes

We gas tank almost empty

No electricity, we oil pressure reading low

Shall we abandon ship

Or shall we stay on it and perish slow""

I will stay on this ship, the NPP will stay on this ship and we shall get it to refloat. We shall restore hope and we shall make Ghana work again and bring back the smile to the faces of our people. The Black Star will shine again!

To the people of Ghana I say, keep hope alive. I believe in Ghana. And, above all, I believe in God. Change will come in 2016. I am ready. Let the journey begin.

God bless the NPP!

God bless Ghana!

God bless Africa!

Thank you.",2014-07-29T18:52:20+0000,status,NA,NA,1418,375,212,2005
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"REGIONAL & CONSTITUENCY NPP CHAIRMEN, MPs DECLARE SUPPORT FOR AKUFO-ADDO

Regional Chairmen, 34 constituency Chairmen of Greater Accra, and 107 NPP Members of Parliament on Tuesday declared their overwhelming support for the candidature of Nana Akufo-Addo ahead of the October 18 presidential primary of the party.

Speaking publicly at an event to kick-start Nana Akufo-Addo's campaign, they said, as delegates, their duty is to vote on behalf of their constituents and that the people they represent have told them to vote for Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.

The event, which saw the streets of Accra brightened by the blue, red and white colours of the NPP was held at Akwei's House in Odododiodio.

The Chairman and constituency executives of the Odododiodio constituency, who began the rounds of endorsement, explained that Nana Akufo-Addo's message is now resonating than ever with his constituents, and when the party consulted the people in their communities it was more than clear that the people are calling for an Akufo-Addo presidency.

So for the 2014 presidential primary, he said, ""the Odododiodio constituency unequivocally supports the candidature of Nana Akufo-Addo and will make sure he wins the 2016 election because we want is power.""

All 34 constituency chairmen in the Greater Accra Region, headed by the ""Chairman of Chairmen"", Mr. Bella of Ablekuma North, also threw their support behind Nana Akufo-Addo.

Chairman Bella, who previously supported Mr. Alan Kyerematen in the previous 2010 contest, noted that all 34 chairmen won their positions as Constituency Chairmen in the region solely because they had pledged to make Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana.

""Ghanaians and our constituents told us that they will not vote for NPP if we do not bring Nana Akufo-Addo. We don't want any experiments in 2016 and we can assure all of you gathered here that all 34 constituency chairmen in the Greater Accra Region will vote for Nana Akufo-Addo,"" Chairman Bella added.

On the part of the Members of Parliament, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, who was accompanied by 106 MPs, recounted how she was ridiculed when she indicated that over 100 NPP MPs support Nana Addo. In fact, she said she was even modest then.

""What you are seeing here today is a clear sign, genuine support. Our hope is Nana Addo. We are MPs who listen to the grassroots and listen to the people we represent. From all parts of the country, everybody you meet is saying they want Nana Akufo-Addo,"" Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey.

""We will do what the people of Ghana want,"" she assured.

Dominic Nitiwul, the Deputy Minority Leader also added his voice to it by saying the country wants an Akufo-Addo-Bawumia presidency to rescue Ghana and bring back hope and relief.

He assured Nana Akufo-Addo and all NPP members gathered that, ""you cannot get 5 MPs who will not vote for Nana Akufo-Addo. Parliament is united behind Nana Akufo-Addo. The time of the other 6 candidates is not now, their time will come. We want to win the majority in parliament. We want to sit on the right side of the speaker, we want to be in government and not opposition. The party is united in one voice. We are going to bring Nana Akufo-Addo.""

The Bimbilla MP had some words of advice for the those contesting Nana Akufo-Addo.

""Be careful of what you say about Nana Akufo-Addo because he will be President in 2017,"" he said.

The Chairman of the Nhyiaeso constituency of the NPP, Mr. Kofi Agyei, alias ""GeoKad"", also endorsed the candidature of Nana Akufo-Addo.

""Geo Kad"" in his own words told the gathering that ""Since 1998, I have never supported Nana. Nana won in all but one constituency in Ashanti region in the 2010 primary, that was my constituency. Today, I can assure you that the door is open for Nana in my constituency. We have to think of power and not our selfish interests. We presented Nana in 2008, 2012 and I believe that in 2016, Nana Akufo-Addo will become President of Ghana.""

John Kumah, a former spokesperson for Alan Kyerematen, also declared his support for Nana. He noted that Maxwell Kofi Jumah, Hon. Gyamfi, who is the Odotobri Chairman, Chairman Wontumi, Andy Kankam, who were once vociferous against the candidature of Nana Akufo-Addo are now working for him.

""What Ghanaians are saying is that they did not know Nana was such a patriotic Ghanaian. His actions after the election petition showed that he always puts Ghana first and not his personal interests and will vote for him in 2016. It is not surprising, therefore, that Ghanaians are now referring to him as 'Aboterewura'"", he stated.

Not to be left out, the Regional Chairman of the NPP in the Greater Accra Region, Mr. Ishmael Ashitey, appealed to the people in the Region to support the NPP and Nana Akufo-Addo because ""times are changing in Ghana.""

The primaries is not our concern, he said, adding that we are focusing on the 2016 election because it is a done deal for Nana Akufo-Addo.

All regional executives, led by the Regional Organiser, Archibald Cobbina, who was a kingpin in the Alan Kyerematen campaign in 2010, also their support for Nana Addo. 

""We are united and solidly behind Nana Akufo-Addo and I am personally going to support Nana Akufo-Addo,"" Archibald Cobbina concluded.",2014-07-29T18:40:32+0000,status,NA,NA,824,160,52,1036

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO SENDS BEST WISHES TO ALL MUSLIMS
 
This is to congratulate all Muslims across the country for a successful completion of the month long Ramadan fast. On behalf of my wife Rebecca and myself, I send you best wishes, and by extension all Muslims across the world, as you celebrate the annual Eid ul-Fitr festival on Monday, August 28.
 
The Eid ul-Fitr celebration commemorates the end of Ramadan, a period of intense devotion and reflection - a time when Muslims have devoted themselves entirely to the will of Allah and to the principles and tenets of the Qu'ran and Sunnah.
 
I believe that this intense period of devotion has inspired in Muslims a commitment not only to God but also to country.
 
The intense flow of Barakat (divine grace) that this one month of spiritual exercise has engendered must trigger a respect for neighbour and country that will enable us all, as God's servants, to join hands in the difficult task of nation building.
 
I urge all Muslims to continue to demonstrate, continually, a sense of unity and oneness in the years ahead.
 
Once again, I am privileged to join many other Ghanaians in wishing you all a happy Eid ul-Fitr celebration. Baraka Da Salla!

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO TO KICK START CAMPAIGN IN ODODODIODIO
 
Nana Akufo-Addo will begin his nationwide campaign tour for the flagbearership of the New Patriotic Party this Tuesday, July 29, at the  Akoto Lante in the Odododiodio constituency, in Accra.
 
Going back to his roots, the venue for this event will be Akwei's House, the historical meeting ground of the United Party (the Danquah-Dombo-Busia family), not far from Betty House, Swalaba, where Akufo-Addo was born.
 
Akufo-Addo will be meeting all 34 NPP constituency chairpersons in the Greater Accra Region, as well as other constituency executives who are expected to show up. NPP Members of Parliament in the region are also expected to turn up.
 
At Akwei's House, Nana Akufo-Addo will address party people, announce his regional campaign co-ordinators, and articulate the theme of his campaign. He will also talk about some of the major issues affecting the country.
 
Though the focus is on party delegates for the primary, Nana Akufo-Addo says the main issue facing Ghanaians now is the economy -- the rising cost of living and cost of production, unemployment and the political turbulence from public agitations, as a result of public anger and disillusionment with the government.
 
Akufo-Addo believes the major issues confronting the people of Ghana today are around the increasing sufferings visited on the people through bad economic policies, the breakdown of social services, and the loss of confidence in the President and his administration to offer credible solutions. In solidarity with business people and consumers, alike, Akufo-Addo will tour the commercial centre of the capital after addressing party people, with visits to Kantamanto, where he will meet leaders of various trade associations and move on to do the same at the Makola Market. From there, he will visit Okaishie, where Akufo-Addo and his entourage, including MPs and other party stalwarts, will interact with traders, shoppers and commuters.
 
The Akufo-Addo campaign train is expected to continue from there to Bolgatanga, in the Upper East region, Wednesday, where he will address party executives from all the constituencies. He will then proceed to Tamale to continue with his nationwide tour, which will take him to all 10 regions. More details of the campaign will be made available on Tuesday.",2014-07-27T19:52:13+0000,status,NA,NA,1336,507,92,1935

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"NPP ORGANIZERS DECLARE SUPPORT FOR AKUFO-ADDO
 
Ringing endorsements of the candidature of Nana Akufo-Addo continue to pour in, as activists in the New Patriotic Party settle on him as their preferred candidate to lead the party into the December 2016 elections.
 
Wednesday morning, 35 constituency Organisers and their deputies in the Greater Accra region called on the “first National Organiser” of the party, at his Nima residence, to reaffirm their “total support for him” ahead of the Special Electoral College, scheduled to take place on 31st August, and the main presidential primary slated for October 18.
 
The organisers led by their “Chairman”, Kwabena Boateng, the constituency organiser for Anyaa Sowutuom,   and spokesperson, Daniel Odei-Appiah, the Korle Klottey constituency organiser, came to reaffirm their support for Nana Akufo-Addo’s  bid.
 
According to the spokesperson, the group had held a press conference earlier this month where they stated reasons why they believed Akufo-Addo was the people’s man, and the preferred candidate of the majority of Ghanaians to return the country onto the path of prosperity after the mess created by John Mahama-led NDC government.
 
They assured Nana Akufo-Addo that they were going to campaign to ensure a massive and landslide victory for him in the Greater Accra region, adding that their commitment and belief in him, as the man for Ghana, will always remain steadfast.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo thanked the constituency organisers for the faith and trust reposed in him, and urged them to help him “jump the first hurdle” which is the Special Electoral College, and subsequently the main presidential primary.
 
He reassured them that the NPP has no choice but to win the 2016 elections so as to create a future of hope for the youth and generations unborn, adding that victory in 2016 can only be achieved when the party is united behind whoever emerges victorious in the primary, stressing that the task ahead “is not a one-man-job.”
 
Nana Addo also admonished all NPP members and supporters of other aspirants to be mindful of their language during the course of the campaign, as this is a small matter of electing a leader between members of the great Elephant party.
 
This is the second endorsement Nana Addo has received from activists and executives of the party from the region after Tuesday’s endorsement by the Greater Accra women’s wing of the party.",2014-07-24T18:37:07+0000,status,NA,NA,979,222,48,1249

The National Chief Imam, Sheikh Dr. Osmanu Nuhu Sharubutu, who, along with other Muslims, is observing the month long fast of Ramadan, Tuesday evening broke his fast with Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, at his Nima residence.
 
This event, which was at the request of Nana Akufo-Addo, had chiefs and opinion leaders from the Muslim community in the Greater Accra region, 7 NPP Muslim Members of Parliament and leaders of the New Patriotic Party, as well as the general public being present.
 
Sheikh Dr. Osmanu Nuhu Sharubutu, on arrival, was met by Nana Akufo-Addo, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, Sheikh I.C. Quaye and Mustapha Abdul Hamid.
 
After breaking their fast with water and fruits, the Chief Imam led the gathering in prayer, after which they shared a meal.   
 
Nana Akufo-Addo thanked the Chief Imam for granting his request. Akufo-Addo paid tribute to Sheikh Dr. Osmanu Nuhu Sharubutu’s life, legacy and significant contributions towards national development, describing him as a “Father to all Ghanaians.”
 
He prayed the Almighty Allah grants him longer life to continue to bless this nation with his wisdom and experience. He thanked the Chief Imam for gracing his home by his presence and observed that by his presence, his home had become a holy place.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo also asked the gathering to pray particularly strongly for the nation because of the difficult times in which Ghanaians currently find themselves. He explained that it was because of the hardships that have engulfed the nation that he, together with others, have put themselves up for national leadership.
 
In this regard, Nana Akufo-Addo asked for support and prayers for himself and his right hand man, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, who is also a Muslim.
 
Nana Addo called for unity in all facets of national life, explaining that he believed in the “unity of our nation, unity of tribes, unity of sexes and unity of religions, for it is in that unity that we find strength.”
 
“When you pray, think of me and pray for me. Ask Allah to give me wisdom, strength, long life and a good heart to achieve the vision I have for this country,” Nana Addo added.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"NPP WOMEN ENDORSE NANA AKUFO-ADDO
 
Over one hundred constituency and polling station women organisers of the New Patriotic Party in the Greater Accra region, Tuesday morning, paid a courtesy call on Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to throw their support behind his candidature in the run-up to the 18th October presidential primary of the party.
 
Led by Madam Akosua Takyiwaa, the Women’s Organiser for the Okaikoi North constituency, the delegates were met by Nana Akufo-Addo, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, his running mate for the 2008 and 2012 elections, and Alhaji Moctar Bamba, former National Organiser of the NPP, who had also come to visit Nana Akufo-Addo.
 
Reading a solidarity message on behalf of the women’s wing, Madam Christina Nkansah, the Women’s Organiser from the La Dadekotopon constituency, stated emphatically that they had resolved to support the candidature of Nana Akufo-Addo, adding that “we would fight tooth and nail for you to win the primaries and subsequently power from the John Mahama-led NDC government.”
 
Citing reasons for their support of Nana Akufo-Addo, Madam Nkansah explained that the decision by Nana Akufo-Addo to contest the presidential primary of the NPP was a show of total commitment to the development of the country.
 
According to her, the women’s wing of the party have come to the realisation that in the face of extreme vilification by some persons, both within and outside of the party, Nana Akufo-Addo “stood firm without looking back. Your commitment to the course of the advancement of the party has remained unshaken.”
 
“Amongst all your peers, you stand tall in popularity and depth of knowledge in issues of governance. The maturity you exhibited after the historic trial challenging the result of the 2012 general elections held the country. Even though the verdict contradicted the logical expectations of many who understand legal procedures and principles you ended up accepting the verdict,” the message read.
 
It is against this background, Madam Nkansah noted, that the women’s wing of the NPP are backing the candidature of Nana Akufo-Addo.
 
“We declare that there is no other person in the party that has the popularity you have to lead us into the 2016 general elections, if we really hope to wrestle power from the NDC who have ruined the economy and have destroyed the core foundation of the development of our dear country,” she added.
 
Dr. Mahamadu Bawumia, who also addressed the women, welcomed their decision to back Nana Akufo-Addo, stating that this was a clear indication of victory in the upcoming presidential primary and in the 2016 election.
 
On his part, Nana Akufo-Addo thanked the women’s wing for the “overwhelming support” they have given him ahead of the 18th October primary. He assured them that when he wins the nomination of the party for the 2016 election, nothing short of victory shall be the portion of the NPP.
 
Akufo-Addo also admonished all NPP members to conduct themselves in a manner that will give Ghanaians the confidence to entrust, once again, the mandate of leadership into the hands of the party.
 
According to him, Ghanaians are praying for the return of the NPP into office, as the state of the nation under the leadership of the John Mahama-led NDC government is nothing to write home about and keeps worsening by the day.      
 
The women organisers also used the opportunity to present 10 cartons of bottled water to Nana Akufo-Addo for use in refreshing guests who call on him at his Nima residence.",2014-07-22T18:46:39+0000,status,NA,NA,950,267,47,1264
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"ABOTER<U+0190>WURA CONFERRED ON AKUFO-ADDO
 
Friday night, at Ofori Panin Fie in Kyebi, the Etwienanahene of Akyem Abuakwa, Barima Kwuku Dua, conferred the title Aboetr<U+0190>wura on Nana Akufo-Addo, the 2012 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo, a grandson of the Okyeman royal family, had his four decades of selfless service to his nation, Ghana, honoured by his household, in a ceremony which took place in the presence of the Okyenhene, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin and his elders.
 
Aboter<U+0190>wura translates into a ""man of exceptional tolerance, perseverance, compassion and patience"".
 
The citation, which summed up the reasons behind the award stated, “With patience, tolerance, courage and a pragmatic sense of urgency, you have, for the last four decades, led from the front the processes that have today made Ghana a peaceful, democratic and respectful nation in Africa today. You have contributed more than your quota to making Ghana a role model for the rest of the continent. Still, you continue to contribute. You continue to serve. You continue to lead.”
 
The low key but colourful ceremony was part of the three days of events to mark the first anniversary of Barima Kwaku Dua's enstoolment.
 
Reading the citation, Mrs Rhoderline Baffour-Gyimah, said, ""We honour you, for your selfless sacrifice to humankind. For your courageous patriotism to your country. For your depthless tolerance of all that is done falsely against your person. For your patience. For your sincerity. For your consistency. For your conviction. For your determination to see Ghana becoming a free and prosperous society. For your commitment to building a society of opportunities for every Ghanaian, no matter the circumstances of birth.""
 
She continued, ""The freedom that we tend to take for granted today were fought and won by patriots like you, who used the exuberance and courage of their youth to struggle against the dictatorship that we were compelled to endure in apathy and fear. Over the years, you have used your wisdom, knowledge and energy to fight, without the tools of war, but with your courage and conviction as your weapons. You fought for our democracy and development. You did not fight for your family, for your ethnic group or for your region. You fought for all Ghanaians. And you did so because you love Ghana. You have fought all your life for what is good for Ghana. You did so because you believe in Ghana. Nana, this is to say to you that we believe in you. That Ghanaians believe in you.""
 
She continued, “When the roll call of the freedom fighters for Ghana are mentioned, Nana, we know yours will be among those at the top. When the roll call of selfless, loyal and trusted Ghanaians are called, Nana, we know your name will be among the top list. You are Ghana's leading living campaigner of free, fair and democratic elections. You are Ghana’s living campaigner for opportunities for the ordinary masses. You are the champion of the poor; of the voiceless; of the Defenseless.”
 
The citation which focused on Akufo-Addo’s patriotic service to Ghana, his fight for the ordinary people and his vision to transform Ghana, also described him as a role model and symbol of hope for the youth of Ghana.
 
“You have reminded us that royalty means loyalty to people and nation. To you, every Ghanaian is an Odehye and must be helped to grow and stand on his or her own two feet. That is the mark of a champion of the masses.
 
“Your character as a servant, a leader, a team player and a compassionate, fair but resolute human being of conviction is a character that is most admired by the youth of today.”
 
Referring to Akufo-Addo’s concern for the young people and their response, it reads, “When the youth of Ghana heard you say that Ghana needed a leader who thought about the next generation and not the next election, in fact, they believed you. Because they know you. They know you better now. Because they know what you have stood for and fought for, and for them to now have the space to dream big.”
 
The citation highlights Akufo-Addo’s consistency and praised him for standing firm on what he believes in and his dream for Ghana, describing him as the “faith carrier of the fulfillment of the dreams of our founding fathers. The dreams that here in Ghana we can build a free, modern and prosperous nation to rival all others. We can do it, because people like you believe it can be done!”
 
It continues, “You have been patiently persistent and consistent on the path that you believe Ghana needs to travel. Your message has not shifted with the convenience tide of saying what may win you a particular election. That temptation for saying what is convenient is not you, Nana.”
 
It sums up Akufo-Addo’s vision: “Ever since you expressed a desire to serve Ghana at the very top, you spelt out your vision: access to free quality, education for every child; access to employable skills for every young person, winning the fight against corruption, playing by the rules of the game, and pulling the human and material resources of Ghana together to industrialise and diversify our economy in order to transform Ghana to transform the lives of the citizens of Ghana.”
 
It reminds us, “Some doubted you. But you stayed true, despite all the vilifications and insults. Today, your name is mentioned whenever school fees are to be paid. Whenever corruption denies funding to a social intervention. Whenever the cedi struggles against the dollar in an economy that struggles to compete. Whenever these things that pull us down happen, Nana, your vision is remembered.”
 
It concludes with Akufo-Addo’s statesmanly acceptance of the decision of the Supreme Court of Ghana a year ago, when he lost the petition to challenge the 2012 presidential election results by a close 5:4 decision.
 
“Your act of statesmanship after you lost the controversial 2012 elections was not new to those who knew you and trusted in you.
 
“You showed what a true patriot you are: selfless, loyal, and trustworthy. You accepted the defeat and in a way that brought peace to a nation on the brink of conflict and social strive. Nana, Ghanaians thank you!”
 
It ends, “Nana, your patience, your tolerance, your love for nation, your perseverance, your capacity to get up, dust yourself down and move on with a smile, after a fall, and go on believing and still believing and working harder and harder to have that belief fulfilled – for this and all that you stand for and live for, we, Etwienananom, hereby, with great pleasure bestow upon you the title: ABOTER<U+0190>-WURA NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO.”

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"GHANA WILL WORK AGAIN, SAYS NANA AKUFO-ADDO
 
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, Monday afternoon, said Ghana was not working under the government of the National Democratic government, but assured Ghanaians to take heart and keep faith because Ghana will work again if the New Patriotic Party is voted into office in 2016.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo made this known when he filed his nomination documents at the NPP headquarters, Asylum Down, Accra. He was the fourth person to file his nomination papers for the 2014 presidential primary, as the opposition party prepares for the December 2016 general elections.
 
Several NPP Members of Parliament found time to accompany Nana Akufo-Addo to the party office from his Nima residence close by.
 
Large numbers of elated NPP members and sympathisers thronged the headquarters of the party to show their support to the candidature of the man they believe can rescue Ghana from the economic hardships, despondency, widespread corruption and rising levels of unemployment the country finds itself in under President Mahama’s NDC government.
 
Responding to the crowd, Nana Akufo-Addo reiterated his commitment to leading a united NPP as a necessary condition to securing victory from the government of the National Democratic Congress.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo, was met at the conference room of the party by General Secretary, Mr. Kwabena Agyepong, who after studying the papers and acknowledging receipt of the GH¢75,000 filing fee presented by Nana Akufo-Addo, accepted the nomination documents as duly filed.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo assured the General Secretary that he was going to abide by the rules and regulations of the primary, as set out by the party, and will also ensure that his supporters do likewise.
 
Addressing journalists gathered at the NPP headquarters, Akufo-Addo stated that he can be trusted to serve the party well, and he has the vision and experience  to inspire and lead the NPP into victory come 2016, adding that “Ghana will work again under my leadership.”
 
To ensure this becomes a reality, Akufo-Addo emphasised that the NPP has a dynamic and competent team to implement plans designed to transform the lives of the Ghanaian people and to develop in Ghana a free, democratic, modern African state – one that can hold its own in a competitive world.
 
Acknowledging the fact that Ghana currently finds herself in difficult times, with a battered and dispirited population, Akufo-Addo reminded NPP supporters that the entire nation is looking up to the NPP to offer the leadership that will rescue Ghana from a clueless and floundering NDC government.
 
“Let’s get together and get Ghana working again,” he admonished NPP supporters.
 
He assured the gathering that ""the NPP is coming back to power in 2016, to continue from where President Kufuor left off.""
 
He urged NPP members to send the good news of the NPP's return, assuring them that in 2016, NPP will not taste defeat again.
 
""Akufo-Addo is the man for the future. Come high, come low we're winning 2016,"" he added.     
 
Nana Akufo-Addo was accompanied by his running mate for the 2008 and 2012 elections, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, Sheikh I.C. Quaye, Nii Adjiri Blankson, Mustapha Abdul Hamid, Frema Opare Osei, and several MPs, including Hon. Sara Adjoa Safo, Hon. Daniel Titus Glover, Hon. Frank Annoh Dompreh, Hon. Isaac Asiamah, Hon. Henry Quartey, Hon. Shirley Ayorkor Botchway and Hon. Gifty Klenam.
 
The others included: Hon. Aboagye Gyedu Kingey, Hon. Alexander Afenyo-Markin, Hon. Kwasi Amoako-Atta, Hon. Moses Anim, Hon. Justice Joe Appiah, Hon. Dr. Nana Ato Arthur, Hon. Solomon N. Boar, Hon. Henry Kokofu, Hon. Gifty Kusi, Hon. Kennedy Osei, Hon. Matthew Nyindam, Hon. Benito Owusu, Hon. Elizabeth Sackey, Hon. Sagre Bambani, Hon. Robert Sarfo-Mensah and Hon. Mustapha Yussif.
 
The crowd, which included several young and women from constituencies in Greater Accra, danced and sang in joy.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Ghana in an era of retrogression, says Nana Akufo-Addo
 
Nana Akufo-Addo, Sunday, lamented the leadership crisis in Ghana and accused President John Mahama’s government of sending the nation backwards.
 
Addressing the UK Branch of the New Patriotic Party’s monthly public meeting on Sunday in Wood Green, London, the man vying to lead the New Patriotic Party in 2016 described the situation in Ghana as, “we are in an era of retrogression.”
 
He added, “You may look at the problems we are facing now and say we have seen all of them before. But, I have been around for sometime now and I don’t remember the last time we had all these problems hitting us at the same time with such force. Ask yourself, why?”
 
He stressed, “No water, no electricity, no petrol, no money, no jobs, no mercy,” and the audience added, “No World Cup victory!”
 
Nana Akufo-Addo, who was in London for a week’s visit, told Ghanaians in London, “it seems whatever the President touches turns into dust. This is, indeed, an era of retrogression. Everything about Ghana appears to be going backwards.”
 
He cited the ill-fated foreign exchange measures announced in February as a typical example. “Even when they try to fix the falling cedi, they end up making it worse. The cedi depreciation was worse in the four months since February, when the stricter rules were announced, than in the previous 4 months. You may ask yourself, why?”
 
He lamented how the government lambasted his 2012 running mate, the economist, Mahamudu Bawumia, “when he warned them that it would not work. He was insulted! Today, Ghana’s cedi is the second worst performing currency in the world. Doing better than only the local currency of conflict-hit Ukraine! Just, ask yourself, why?”
 
With a chuckle, the seasoned politician added to laughter from the gathering, “Not even our favourite past time, football, has been spared this era of repression. Under President Kufuor, we got through the group stages. Under Mills we got to the Quarter Finals. Under Mahama, we expected to at least match our old performances. But, we did worse in Brazil than in 2006. Ask yourself, why?”
 
Although, he said he did not agree with the pressures the national football team put on the authorities to get paid before playing, he could see how the public sympathised with their concerns.
 
“I am not saying I support the way the players held the nation to ransom before our crucial match against Portugal. But, were you surprised that the Black Stars wanted cash in hand before playing? It is because nobody trusts this government to deliver on its promises. This is a government that finds nothing wrong when the law has levied taxes on people for those revenues to be paid directly in statutory funds like the GETFUND, District Assembly Common Fund, and NHIS. If a government can refuse to pay money to an institution the law says it should, then how can we expect the Black Stars to expect to be paid on a word of promise from the President?” Akufo-Addo queried.
 
He said, the announcement by the credit rating company, Moody’s last Friday, was just the latest of how the world had lost confidence in the capacity of the government to manage the economy.
 
Moody’s downgraded Ghana from B1 to B2, describing the outlook as negative.
 
“What it means is that Ghana will now pay more in interest rates to borrow,” Akufo-Addo explained.",2014-06-30T17:55:16+0000,status,NA,NA,1688,552,214,2454

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO’S RAMADAN MESSAGE TO MUSLIMS
 
I extend fraternal greetings to all Muslims in Ghana and across the world as they prepare to start the fast of Ramadan. Ramadan is a period of intense devotion and reflection - a time when Muslims fast during the day and perform prayers at night, reciting and listening to the entire Qur’an over the course of the month. The rigours undertaken by devout Muslims inspire respect for Islam among people of all faiths and this can bring hope of greater understanding for goodwill.
 
“Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may ward off evil” so states the Qur’an. It is therefore my prayer that Muslims will use this holy month of Ramadan to pray for Allah to ward off the evils that plague our society and draw us back – corruption, nepotism, ethnicity, hate politics, poverty, ignorance and disease. Ramadan should unite us and instil in us fellow-feeling, so that we can create a society where Allah is truly our anchor against the storms of life.
 
Fasting is also a celebration of commitment and obedience to God and also of God’s mercy and provision for all of us. It is a time of family, community and charity. I therefore believe in the possibility of the overflow of old boundaries when wholehearted devotion to one’s own faith is matched with a devout respect for the faith of others and I call on all our Muslim brothers and sisters to demonstrate continually this sense of unity and oneness in the years ahead.
 
Once again, I wish you Allah’s guidance and peace as you observe this truly unique month of blessing. Salamu Alaikum!

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO MOURNS PASSING OF GLADYS ASMAH
 
I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mrs. Gladys Asmah, which occurred at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital on Tuesday. 
 
As a founding member and a stalwart in the New Patriotic Party, she served as a role model and a source of inspiration to many and will be sorely missed.
 
During the fight for the reinstatement of multi-party democracy in our country, and in the formation of the NPP, Mrs. Asmah played a very important role. She was the first Minister for Women and Children Affairs and the first Minister for Fisheries in the history of our country. The achievements she chalked in both Ministries were remarkable. She was an excellent and trustworthy colleague.  
 
I visited her at Korle Bu whilst she was on admission, and hoped that she was on the road to recovery. However, our Father in Heaven knows best. Hers was a life well lived.
 
My condolences go to her family, the NPP family and the entire nation of Ghana.
 
May she rest in perfect peace, and may God bless her soul.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO REPLIES DAN ABODAPKI:
“KUFUOR HAD NO HAND IN YOUR PROSECUTION”
 
The contents of an interview granted by Mr Dan Abodakpi on Adom FM’s Dwaso Nsem morning show on Monday June 23, 2014, have been brought to my notice. Of particular concern to me are some allegations made by the former Minister of Trade under President Rawlings regarding his prosecution and subsequent conviction by the Accra Fast Track High Court.
 
It may be recalled that on February 5, 2007, the Court, after an exhaustive trial, found Mr Abodakpi and one other guilty on seven counts of conspiracy to commit crime, defrauding by false pretences and wilfully causing financial loss to the State.
 
I find it unfortunate that Mr Abodakpi, who has announced his intention to contest for the chairmanship of the National Democratic Congress, will drag President Kufuor and I into his party’s internal contest.
 
In the interview, Mr Abodakpi claimed that, on the decision to prosecute him, he knew “for a fact” that I, as Attorney-General, advised President Kufuor “that this is not the way to go on this matter.” He further alleged,  “I know President Kufuor himself called for the docket and ordered some people to proceed with the prosecution. It wasn’t Nana Akufo-Addo who presented my case in court.”
 
I am surprised that a senior political figure such as Ambassador Abodapki would make such an unguarded statement.  Mr Abodapki could not have known for a fact that I, as Attorney-General, was against his prosecution since no prosecution can go forward unless the Attorney-General is satisfied that a prima facie case has been raised against the accused.  Political considerations do not enter into the matter.
 
In any event, professional advice that an Attorney-General (or any Minister of State for that matter) gives to the President of the Republic is privileged communication, not public information.
 
Secondly, the Constitution of the Republic makes it clear that the power to prosecute any criminal case is given exclusively to the Attorney-General. The President has nothing to do with it. As Attorney-General, I was not aware of President Kufuor ever calling for the docket of the case involving Mr Abodapki or any other case for that matter.
 
Thirdly, criminal trials by the Attorney-General’s Department are usually conducted by the Director of Public Prosecutions or his/her subordinates.  So, it is not at all strange for the Attorney-General not to be personally involved in proceedings of a criminal trial.

Again, Mr Abodapki describes his prosecution as “persecutorial,” creating the impression that the Kufuor government was “able to work out such that some people on the Bench can be on the beck and call” of the President. Allegations of this nature are unfortunate because of their tendency to undermine the independence of the Judiciary.
 
Furthermore, his claim that the New Patriotic Party came to office with a “policy” to “jail all the members of this or that party so that [the NPP] shall be stronger” is completely unfounded.
 
Under the Kufuor administration, at least three prominent figures of the NDC, including current ministers, Kwesi Ahwoi and Sherry Ayitey, and Seti Ocran, were all acquitted by the courts. And, there were no attempts by Attorney-General Akufo-Addo to appeal against their acquittals.
 
Is it, therefore, being suggested that the criminal cases brought, under the NDC administration, against former senior officials of the Kufuor government, including former Chief of Staff Kwadwo Mpiani, former Foreign Minister Osei Adjei, former Minister of Transport Richard Anane, former Minister of Information Asamoah Boateng, are all ‘persecutorial’ and driven by a deliberate ‘policy’ to make the NDC ‘stronger’ at the expense of trumped up charges against their political opponents?
 
The NPP is founded on the principles of democratic accountability, individual liberty and responsibility, the rule of law and fairness. Both President Kufuor and I are firm believers in these principles. We believe in punishing wrongdoing, which Ambassador Abodapki recognises as legitimate, and not persecuting our political opponents. The integrity of Ghana’s democracy demands that we all respect decisions of the courts, including the ones which may affect us personally and with which we may disagree.
 
The allegations by Mr Abodapki on these matters are, with respect, false and I hope that this statement from me will help set the records straight. I have also taken note of the fact that President Kufuor has issued a statement, through his spokesperson, Frank Agyekum, denying these allegations.
 
I, nevertheless, wish Mr Abodakpi the best of luck with his campaign to be the National Chairman of the National Democratic Congress.

I am deeply saddened by the news of the passing of a great religious figure of our country, the Ameer and Missionary-in-Charge of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission, Maulvi Dr. Wahab A. Adam.
 
The Ghanaian nation is indebted to him for his many years of service and dedication to the country, and the profound contribution he made to its spiritual and moral welfare.
 
Maulvi Wahab Adam and I always had a good personal and working relationship. Indeed, as Attorney General, I had the privilege of recommending him to President Kufuor for appointment as a member of the National Reconciliation Commission, which was set up to heal the wounds of the nation after decades of military rule. According to all accounts, he excelled in the work of the Commission. A few months ago, when I was in London, Maulvi Wahab Adam was kind enough to invite me to attend a conference of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission, which proved to be an interesting experience for me.
 
Ghana has lost a most illustrious son.
 
My sincere condolences and sympathies go to his family and all Ahmadi Muslims across the country and the world.

He was met at the conference room by the National Chairman of the party, Paul Afoko and 2nd NPP Vice chairman, Sammy Crabbe. Akufo-Addo presented his receipt of the payment to Paul Afoko, who then went ahead to present the nomination forms to Nana Addo.

Akufo-Addo took the opportunity to assure the chairman that he was going to abide by the rules and regulations of the contest and ensure that his supporters do likewise.",2014-06-12T14:39:50+0000,status,NA,NA,1675,771,87,2533
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO CONGRATULATES ORGANISERS OF “YA Y<U+0190> D<U+0190>N” DEMONSTRATION
 
This is to congratulate the constituency and regional executives of the New Patriotic Party in the Ashanti region, the NPP Members of Parliament from the Ashanti caucus, and members of the planning committee for the successful, peaceful nature of Tuesday’s “Ya Y<U+0190> d<U+0190>n” demonstration.
 
Particularly, I congratulate the over five hundred thousand (500,000) Ghanaians who were present at the demonstration. Clearly and unequivocally, they voiced out their concerns and displeasure about the growing levels of economic hardships they are facing on a daily basis under the current NDC government.
 
Yesterday’s demonstration was also a clear message to all NPP faithful. Ghanaians are very unhappy with their lot, and expect us to rescue them from the despondency, rising cost of living, unprecedented levels of unemployment and widespread corruption they have been plunged into by President John Mahama and his NDC government. We dare not fail them, and can only do so with a united front.
 
As we embark on the journey of electing a presidential candidate for the 2016 elections, I ask all NPP members to be reminded of the scenes of distressed Ghanaians at the demonstration who are yearning for the NPP’s return to power. We must show to Ghanaians that we have the policies and programmes to transform our country, and move them out of the current mess into which our beloved Ghana has been engulfed. With determination, unity, hardwork and honest leadership, Ghana can overcome her current problems and achieve the potential which inspired our forefathers to begin the struggle for freedom and independence. Long live Ghana! God bless us all.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO WISHES BLACK STARS WELL AHEAD OF WORLD CUP
 
As the Black Stars make their third consecutive appearance at football's biggest tournament, I join all Ghanaians in wishing them the very best of luck and urge them to make the Ghanaian nation proud one more time.
 
Football pundits, all over the world, have always bet their money on Ghana being one of the first teams to exit the World Cup at the group stages. In our maiden appearance in 2006, when we were grouped with the likes of Italy, the Czech Republic and the USA, the odds were heavily stacked against us. However, the can-do-spirit of the Ghanaian was clearly made manifest and we came second in this group and qualified for the round of 16.
 
Similarly in 2010, against the likes of Germany, Serbia and Australia, we progressed to the quarter finals stage, a step further to what was achieved in 2006. I have no doubt whatsoever that, again, in Brazil, with a group consisting of Germany, Portugal and the USA, the Black Stars will shine even brighter.  
 
I believe strongly that with unity, determination and hard work from captain Asamoah Gyan and our players, the Kwasi Appiah-led technical team and management, and the unflinching support of us all, the Black Stars will make us proud. Best of luck! God bless!

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"PRESIDENT KUFUOR AND I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP
 
My attention has been drawn to ongoing media reportage and commentary being made by some members of the New Patriotic Party, and, unsurprisingly, by our political opponents to the effect there is a fractured relationship between President John Agyekum Kufuor and myself.
 
The allegations that are making the rounds include the fact that President Kufuor did not support my presidential bids in 2008 and in 2012, and is also not in support of my bid to lead the party into the 2016 general elections, amongst others.
 
I would like to place on record that these allegations, pointing to an unhealthy relationship between President Kufuor and myself, are false.
 
In 2008, President Kufuor, when President of the Republic, supported fully my bid to become president of our country and gave me his unstinting assistance. Likewise, in 2012, the support I received from him was unflinching, as it was during the entire course of the now famous election petition. It remains my firm conviction that his two-term government, in which I had the privilege to serve as Attorney General and Foreign Minister, has been the best government this country has had, and I am proud to have been a member of it. Never has there been a point in time where our former President has done anything detrimental to me, as a person, or to the party with me as its presidential candidate. As far as the 2016 election is concerned, President Kufuor has made it clear to all and sundry that he does not support any particular candidate and will work to help whoever emerges from the presidential primary as the party’s candidate.
 
These false allegations do not bode well for our internal cohesion as a party, and I plead with all members who have been fed with these untruths to desist from propagating them any further. Such unguarded pronouncements could give our opponents comfort from their non-performance.
 
I am compelled to inform the public that President Kufuor and I remain in regular communication with each other, and I make it a point to visit him every week. Such actions cannot be suggestive of a fractured relationship between two colleagues.
 
I urge NPP faithful not to be side-tracked by such falsehoods, but remain focused, bearing in mind that the people of Ghana are looking up to us to make the necessary arrangements that will give them the confidence to trust us with the mandate to serve them once again.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO REACTS TO FALSE REPUBLIC PUBLICATION - YET ANOTHER LIE

Yet again, the office of Nana Akufo-Addo has been compelled to react to a publication in the Republic newspaper, one of the many pro-NDC papers dedicated to publishing falsehoods about Nana Akufo-Addo.

The story in the paper with headline “NPP gurus hot over ‘Le Baron’ cocaine saga”, and which has been reproduced subsequently on Ghanaweb and Peacefmonline, tries desperately to create a linkage between the owner of Le Baron, a hotel in East Legon, Accra, who has been arrested in the United Kingdom for allegedly engaging in drug trafficking and money laundering, and Nana Akufo-Addo.

The story claims that one Mr. David Kwadwo Anim, owner of Le Baron, is a friend and major financier of Nana Akufo-Addo, who went to the extent of donating US$2 million to the campaign of the 2012 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party.

For the avoidance of doubt, these statements by the Republic are nothing but lies and deliberate fabrications designed in a desperate attempt to tarnish, once again, the image of Nana Akufo-Addo. Mr. David Anim is not a friend of Nana Akufo-Addo. Indeed, Nana Akufo-Addo does not recollect ever having met him. The alleged donation of US$2 million to the campaign of Nana Akufo-Addo, as reported by the paper, is also a big lie.

In addition, Nana Akufo-Addo has never been arrested at Heathrow Airport or any other airport anywhere in the world. Once again, this is a wicked lie to sour the reputation of a man whose life has been a matter of public knowledge. Not surprisingly, no details of the alleged arrest are provided by the paper, other than the bald allegation.

We urge Ghanaians to disregard these stories, which have proven over the years to be deliberate ploys by pro-NDC papers to try to tarnish and damage the reputation of Nana Akufo-Addo. We insist that the Republic newspaper, Ghanaweb and Peacefmonline withdraw these allegations and apologise for them.

We, however, wish to state that this will be the very last time that the office of Nana Akufo-Addo will be responding to falsehoods and deliberate acts of defamation against his person by these pro-NDC newspapers through the use of this medium. The next response to such defamatory publications will be to seek redress at the National Media Commission and the courts of law. It is obvious that these wicked and evil lies against Nana Akufo-Addo and the NPP are intended to divert the attention of the Ghanaian people from the widespread corruption and bad governance of the NDC that is imposing intolerable hardships on Ghanaians. These crude ploys will fail. Ghanaians can see through them.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"REFRAIN FROM ACTS THAT COULD JEOPARDISE PARTY UNITY
 
Nana Akufo-Addo has again called on his supporters to refrain from any negative acts or statements that could jeopardise the unity of the New Patriotic Party. In this regard, he refers supporters to the statement in his Easter message:
 
“In particular, I urge all NPP members, who support my bid to lead the Party for the 2016 elections, not to be provoked by comments or actions, and be dragged into any discourse that may damage the Party’s forward march to victory. This is but a contest between members of one family, the Great Elephant family. We must, therefore, be guided and guarded constantly by an uncompromising sense of unity, fellowship and greater purpose.
 
The NPP has always stood for competition and choice, and I am a firm believer in these principles. Just as delegates of our Party have always done, they will, at the right time, choose the candidate who they believe will best serve the interests of the Party going forward.    
 
The people of Ghana are looking up to us to make the necessary arrangements that will give them the confidence to trust us with the mandate to serve them once again. Ghanaians are looking to the NPP to restore hope and offer the kind of purposeful leadership that will speed up the development of our nation and the prosperity of every Ghanaian.”",2014-05-20T18:30:54+0000,status,NA,NA,1197,347,102,1646

I join many other people across the world in extending my warmest congratulations to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister-elect Narendra Modi on their resounding electoral victory in India’s historic national elections.
 
The 540 million voters out of 814 million eligible voters, representing a record 66.4% turnout, who cast their vote in the 5 week long electoral process, have spoken loudly and clearly. It is the first time in three decades that voters have delivered a resounding mandate to a single party to rule the world's second-most populous nation.
 
The margin of victory chalked by the BJP is a clear indication that the people of India have voted massively for change. It is a ringing endorsement of the pro-business credentials of their new leader who had, at the heart of his campaign, a pledge to revive the nation's flagging economy, thereby creating jobs for the millions of unemployed youth.
 
India has set an example for the world in holding the largest democratic election in history, which has been touted as being free, fair and transparent.  
 
I wish the BJP, the newly elected Prime Minister and the people of India the very best of luck in the years to come as India reinforces its position in the world as a prosperous, democratic state.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Akufo-Addo meets South Africa’s Independent Electoral Commission
 
The Chair of the Commonwealth Observer Mission for the May 7 South African national and provincial elections, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on Sunday, met with Commissioners of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) of South Africa, the permanent body created to promote and safeguard a credible electoral system in the country.
 
The meeting, organised by the IEC, was intended to brief international observers, who have been accredited to monitor Wednesday’s elections, including a large African Union (AU) contingent, led by President J.A Kufuor, and a group from the Southern African equivalent of ECOWAS, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), about the preparedness of the Commission and the measures that have been put in place to ensure a successful election.
 
The briefing, which was held at the Results Operation Centre of the IEC, located at the Pretoria Show Grounds, had the deputy Chairperson of the IEC, Mr. Terry Tselane and Mr. Granville Abrahams, Manager of Electoral Affairs, briefing observers present at the meeting. 
 
According to Mr. Tselane, there are four key areas which will determine whether the elections in South Africa will be credible or not. These areas, he stated, include the quality of the voters’ register, quality of the electoral staff, quality of logistics for Election Day, and finally a conducive political environment.
 
He explained that a total of 25,390,159 South Africans had been registered for the elections, out of a population of some 53 million people, representing 47.9% of the total population. He further indicated that a total of 218,000 electoral staff had been properly trained and were ready for deployment. In addition to the 218,000 electoral staff, Mr Tselane revealed that a “buffer staff” had been trained and were on standby to be deployed to polling stations which face logistical and operational difficulties on election day.
 
Mr. Tselane added that all election materials, as at Sunday, had been distributed to all the polling districts in the country. He therefore assured the observers that the IEC was satisfied about what they had achieved so far and were ready to deliver a credible, free, fair and transparent election come May 7.
 
 
Electoral Affairs

Mr. Granville Abrahams, the IEC’s Manager for Electoral Affairs, also briefed the observers on the operational processes that have led to the May 7 elections.
 
He pointed out that a total of 22,263 polling districts had been set up for the elections. Out of this number, 1,255 voting districts, where voter populations are high, will have “sub-centres”, whose aim is to ensure that the time it takes for voters to cast their ballot is drastically reduced.   
 
Mr. Abrahams indicated that maps, containing the IEC’s proposed locations for electoral districts, are given to political parties for their inputs to be made as to whether they agree or otherwise to the location of these districts.
 
As contained in the electoral legislation, Mr. Abrahams revealed that there has been a continuous registration of voters in the country. Also, a period of 2 weeks was given for the registration of voters abroad, with more than 26,000 voters registering to vote on May 7. Prisoners were also allowed to register, he added.
 
On the training of the 218,000 electoral staff, he stated that the training was “broken down into 3 modules”. The first training module, Mr. Abrahams said, was on the importance of democracy, with the second training on the registration of voters. The third and final training module, he added, was election day processes and activities.
 
“Public servants, municipal officials, teachers and other volunteers make up the 218,000 strong electoral staff,” he added.
 
Mr. Abrahams said that special voting was open to all voters, who for one reason or the other cannot vote on voting day, as well for all those who are sick “and qualify for a home visit.”
 
Ballot papers, the IEC man revealed, have numerous security features embossed on them, thus making it difficult to counterfeit.
 
 
Declaration of Results

According to Mr. Abrahams, the law requires that results of elections must be announced within 7 days after the close of polls, stressing that results cannot be declared within the first 48 hours. This, he maintained, was very important so as to ensure that appeals from political parties, that may impact on the final results, are addressed before final declaration is made by the IEC.
 
He also explained that an audit of the results at every counting station is done by an internationally recognised audit firm, before the final results are transmitted to the IEC’s Results Operation Centre.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo was accompanied by the other two members of the Observer Mission, Hon. Dorothy Pine-McLarty OJ, Chairperson of the Electoral Commission of Jamaica, Sheikh Abdul Carimo Nordine Sau, who is the President of the National Elections Commission of Mozambique and a team from the Commonwealth Secretariat.",2014-05-05T19:41:52+0000,status,NA,NA,680,118,39,837

Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,

I thank etv-Ghana for this initiative and I thank the public for the great honour done me by voting me as Ghana’s Most Influential Personality for the year 2013. I congratulate my fellow winners for their service to our nation. I am deeply humbled by the award and I accept the challenge that it poses in what the public expects of the leadership of our nation. 

I understand that what earned me this award is the now famous election petition and my reaction to the majority verdict of the Supreme Court, a reaction which helped reinforce the peace and stability of Ghana. Obviously, I would have preferred to get such a prestigious award under happier circumstances, but to quote Shakespeare in “As You Like It”:

“Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.” 

As I said on the day of the verdict on August 29, 2013 and let me recall my very words: “Everything in my bones, in my upbringing and in what I have done with my life thus far, makes it imperative that I accept a decision made by the highest court of the land, however much I dislike or disagree with it.”

In other words, this is who I am. I believe in the rule of law and I believe that, when you are in a position of leadership, you are obliged to put the larger interest ahead of your personal considerations. I am glad that, when put to the test on my often stated beliefs, I was not found wanting. And I am very grateful that this has been acknowledged and rewarded by the viewers of etv Ghana.  

Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, being influential means you are able to change, hopefully in a positive manner, the way people think and behave. If a few more Ghanaians would have been moved by my conduct in the election petition to become ardent believers in the rule of law and be persuaded to accept personal disappointments to the greater good of our nation, I daresay my adversity, which I consider to be temporary, would have been worth it. 

Growing up as a young boy in the heart of Accra, it was my dream to fight for the cause of my country. Decades later, that dream still lives on and now, even more than ever. I have understood my calling as a lawyer, businessman and politician to serve my society, my people and my country. And it is my belief that we can only build a strong and prosperous Ghana on a solid foundation of personal integrity and love of our nation.

A strict adherence to the rule of law is the best protection for all citizens and those in government, in particular, who would be exposed to family and other pressures. If we play by the rules, there will be confidence in the governance system and it will be easier to gain the support of the people to sacrifice, if need be, during times of difficulty.

To gain the attachment of the people, we must restore hope and that is best done when all the people feel there is a level playing field to achieve their aspirations. We can tell that hope is restored and confidence is high, when our educational and training institutions are turning out skilled and well equipped young people who turn their energies into producing wealth for our nation. We shall know we are on the right path when our young people see their future here in Ghana and are influenced by a political leadership that takes decisions based on the greater good, a leadership guided by the needs of the next generation, not the next election.
    
Our people are yearning for inspired leadership and it is time to close our ranks as a people and unite in the singular purpose of developing our nation. Throughout history, it is when things are at their most difficult that there has been the need for great leaders.
 
When, 67 years ago, George Grant, J.B Danquah, R.S Blay, Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey, Ebenezer Ako Adjei, Cobbina Kessie, William Ofori-Atta, Edward Akufo-Addo and the others formed the United  Gold Coast Convention, UGCC of most blessed memory, as the vehicle in the struggle for independence, they envisaged a just and equitable country. Their aspirations were to build a free, modern and prosperous nation. I have no doubt at all in my mind that, when Kwame Nkrumah stood on the podium at the Old Polo Grounds that night of independence, shouting himself hoarse with “freedom, freedom, freedom”, present day Ghana is not reaping the fruits of freedom that he envisaged. 

Fifty-seven years after independence, Ghanaians have a right to expect a more developed and prosperous nation. Over the past years, I have travelled the length and breadth of our country listening to the people of Ghana. Their wants are reasonable. From Zabzugu to Ada, Achiase to Zebilla, the call has been the same: we want good education for our children, we want jobs, we want to be able to afford three square meals a day, we want better healthcare, we want to live in decent homes. For a country blessed with abundant natural resources and a hardworking population, these needs can be satisfied. There is a large pool of rich human capital available in our country and we only need to harness it to turn our dreams of a prosperous country into reality. For that, we need, above all, honest government.

The list of persons seen to be influential that has been presented to us tonight covers the world of politics, of business, of religion, of the arts, of sports and other critical aspects of life. Our people know that all the different aspects of our lives must function well and in harmony for the nation to move forward. 

We have learnt through painful experience that, unless we get our politics right, it is almost impossible for the other parts to function well. As the business community is discovering in these tumultuous times, the most astute business person is bound to struggle if there is a loss of confidence in the political decision-making process and the management of the national economy. And as we have all been told recently in rather dramatic circumstances, even the business of saving souls suffers when the Bank of Ghana makes unexpected decisions.

Those in positions of leadership do not always realize the effect of what they say or do on the events and lives of the people. Admittedly, it is a great responsibility that leaders bear to have always to keep an eye out for the greater good. I do not know if many or any of my colleague award winners set out deliberately to influence the public. I do know that it is easier simply to try to do the right thing and do the things that you believe in. That is certainly what I have been trying to do with my life in the practice of law, in business and in politics these past how many years.

I thank the organisers once again for the award. It is good to be able to show that standing up for the rule of law and demonstrating strong leadership have their rewards.
 
Thank you and God bless Ghana.",2014-05-01T00:38:47+0000,status,NA,NA,1657,601,256,2514
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO RECEIVES 2013 NYUPED NATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD

The Northern Youth for Peace and Development (NYUPED), on Tuesday, presented the “2013 NYUPED National Achievement Award” to the 2012 presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.

Presenting the award, the Executive Director of NYUPED, Mr. Prince Hardi Adams, explained that the choice of the 2012 NPP flagbearer for the award was reached after a board meeting held on the 15th of October 2013, where it was unanimously agreed that Nana Akufo-Addo should receive the award.

According to Mr Adams, Nana Akufo-Addo was presented with the award “because of your achievements over the years as a dedicated leader for Ghana and your ideal democratic maturity in the just ended Presidential Election Petition.”

“We have unanimously decided to add this local award to the already prestigious national and international awards that have been given to you in recognition of your great achievements and love for our country Ghana, upon your acceptance of the verdict of the Supreme Court, and your decision not to seek a review thereafter,” Mr Adams said.

The Executive Director further added that the decision to award Nana Akufo-Addo was also reached because of the immense contributions he has made to the socio-economic and human capital development of the Ghanaian people.

“In fact as a son of our dear country, and coming from humble beginnings, you have emerged as a giant to give hope to our under-privileged brothers and sisters, especially those coming from the Northern Regions and the entire Ghanaian people,” Mr. Hardi said.

He continued, “You have demonstrated that with God, hard work, dedication, resilience and focus, everything is possible to achieve as a Ghanaian.”

Nana Akufo-Addo, on his part, thanked NYUPED for the honour done him. He urged leadership and entire membership of NYUPED to remain focussed in their quest to ensure development and peace abounds in the 3 Northern regions.",2014-04-30T12:55:02+0000,status,NA,NA,907,244,74,1225

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""R.I. Alhassan was a man of principle and fairness"" - Akufo-Addo

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, Sunday morning, joined thousands of Ghanaians, in Tamale, to pay tribute and celebrate the life and legacy of the late Alhaji Roland Issifu Alhassan, who passed away after a short illness on the 14th of  April, at the 37 Military Hospital, Accra.

Delivering a brief statement at the “Adua”, held at the residence of the late Alhaji R.I.Alhassan, Nana Addo explained that all lawyers called to the bar during his time regarded the late Alhaji R.I Alhassan ""as a legend of the legal profession.""
 
Nana Addo said that his first encounter with the late Alhaji Alhassan occurred when, as General Secretary of the broad based People's Movement for Freedom and Justice (PMFJ), he elicited the support of R.I Alhassan in the “NO"" Campaign during the UNIGOV referendum of 1978, which ultimately brought about the downfall of the Acheampong military government in 1978, and the restoration of multi-party democratic rule to the country in 1979.
 
Describing him as “a man of principle and fairness,” Nana Addo recounted two instances during his tenure as Attorney General and subsequently as Minister of Foreign Affairs when advice given to him by the late R.I Alhassan impacted positively on his life and career.
 
""The Nation and Party have lost an extraordinary man,"" Nana Addo added. He expressed his condolences to the family and urged them to stay strong in these trying times. 
 
The ceremony attracted a high powered delegation from the New Patriotic Party, led by party chairman, Mr Paul Afoko, who was accompanied by some of his national officers; Government, led by Alhaji Mahama Iddrisu; the People's National Convention led by its party chairman, Alhaji Ramadan; and the Convention People's Party.
 
Tributes were read by his wife, children, former Members of Parliament in the Third Republic, the NPP and Government.
 
The late R.I Alhassan became the first ever lawyer to hail from the Northern Region.
 
He was the MP of Chereponi in the Northern Region in 1965, which he remained until the coup d'état in 1966. In the late 70s, he joined the Popular Front Party led by the late Victor Owusu and stood as MP in Tolon in 1979 and was duly elected Member of Parliament.

He was also the leader of the opposition at the time of the 1981 coup.

In the early 90's he invited the members of the Danquah-Busia club to meet in his house to discuss party politics, which was the beginning of the formation of the NPP.  In 1992, he was elected as Vice Presidential Candidate of the NPP, led, at the time by Prof. Albert Adu Boahen.

When the NPP won the 2000 elections, under the leadership of President Kufuor, the late R.I Alhassan was appointed Ghana's Ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2006.
He remained active in politics and was appointed as NPP Regional Campaign Chairman in the North in the 2008 elections.  He was also the Chairman of the Council of Elders of the NPP for the Northern Region. Even during illness, he was consulted and resolved many party issues.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO’S EASTER MESSAGE TO GHANAIANS
 
I send my best wishes to Ghanaians, Christians, and members of the New Patriotic Party during the Easter celebrations.
 
Let us use these Holy Days to reflect on the momentous sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for each of us, and to celebrate the triumph of His Resurrection. It is a time for renewed hope amidst continued challenges our country is currently facing.
 
I appeal to all NPP supporters to remain calm and focussed, and desist from actions that undermine the unity of the party. I reiterate, once again, my appeal to all NPP members to rally behind the newly elected national officers as they rapidly roll out their plans for victory in 2016.
 
In particular, I urge all NPP members, who support my bid to lead the party for the 2016 elections, not to be provoked by comments or actions, and be dragged into any discourse that may damage the party’s forward march to victory. This is but a contest between members of one family, the Great Elephant family. We must, therefore, be guided and guarded constantly by an uncompromising sense of unity, fellowship and greater purpose.
 
The NPP has always stood for competition and choice, and I am a firm believer in these principles. Just as delegates of our party have always done, they will, at the right time, choose the candidate who they believe will best serve the interests of the party going forward.      
 
The people of Ghana are looking up to us to make the necessary arrangements that will give them the confidence to trust us with the mandate to serve them once again. Ghanaians are looking to the NPP to restore hope and offer the kind of purposeful leadership that will speed up the development of our nation and the prosperity of every Ghanaian.
 
Let us use this Easter celebration to renew and strengthen our faith in God and conduct ourselves in a manner that underlines our commitment to the fact that there is hope for the future of both our country and the NPP.
 
I wish all Ghanaians a Happy Easter.
 
May God bless our country Ghana, the NPP, and us all.

This is to congratulate the new National Chairman, Mr. Paul Afoko, and the other national officers of the New Patriotic Party who were elected in the party’s National Delegates’ Conference held in Tamale.
 
I congratulate the party for the peaceful, credible, efficient and successful manner in which the elections for our national executives were conducted. It has been exciting and competitive. The high level of participation, enthusiasm and camaraderie that this election generated among our activists gives an indication of their collective energy and commitment to the struggle ahead in 2016.
 
Internal party contests are not about winners and losers. They are about the party winning. We should all, in the true spirit of our party’s tradition, rally behind our new national officers to strengthen our resolve and singleness of purpose to capture power in 2016.
 
In this regard, I also urge our new national officers to reach out and bring on board their fellow competitors who were not victorious on the day. This is the only way we can forge ahead, as a united party, in our quest to restore hope to Ghanaians. I reiterate, once again, my appeal to all former executives to stay engaged in the activities of the Party.
 
We should all remember that the Ghanaian people are looking up to us to provide a strong, positive direction to deliver them from the failing government of the NDC. We should not fail them.
 
May God bless our party, our country Ghana and us all.

We are somewhat surprised that a paper of the Chronicle’s reputation made no efforts, whatsoever, in contacting Nana Akufo-Addo or any member of his staff to confirm or otherwise the veracity of this story.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ALHAJI YAKUBU TALI, TOLON-NAA – SPEECH BY NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO, 2012 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY, AT MEMORIAL RITES IN TOLON IN HONOUR OF THE LATE TOLON NAA ON 11TH APRIL 2014. 

As-salamu alaykum

I am truly honoured to have the opportunity to join this famous family to celebrate the life of one of the historic figures of modern Ghana, an illustrious son of the North, the late Tolon Naa, Alhaji Yakubu Tali.

I salute the family and all those who, through diverse efforts, have ensured that this event has been successfully put together. It is a happy coincidence that this ceremony is taking place on the eve of the National Delegates’ Conference in Tamale of the New Patriotic Party, the political party whose forebears he served with such distinction. It has enabled the leadership and members of the Party to be present here in Tolon on this occasion, to add our voice to the commemoration of this hardworking, most praise worthy man, whose life continues to inspire us. 

The late Alhaji Yakubu-Tali was born in 1916 at Tali, a village 32 kilometers from Tamale, to the late Tali Na, Alhassan Sulemana, and Madam Ayishetu. Through both parents, he belonged to the royal families of Tolon and Kumbungu. Like myself, dare I say it myself, in his youthful days, Na Yakubu Tali was a good footballer. 
He started school at the age of nine. At the time, students were identified by the names of their villages. This served as a means of distinguishing between students who bore similar names, hence the name Yakubu Tali.

In his youth, the policy of the colonial government was to ensure that no student from the Northern Territories, no matter how academically sound, was allowed into the secondary division of Achimota school. However, he could not be kept out, and Yakubu Tali became the first Northerner to attend Achimota School in the 1930s.

On leaving Achimota in 1937 and for a period of nine years, he taught in several schools in the then Northern Territories, where he was a most effective teacher. Wherever he went, he became an inspiration to parents and students alike.   

His political life begun in 1948 when he was elected a representative of the Western Dagomba District Council to the Northern Territories Council. He was elected as the President of the Northern Territories Council six times in succession from 1952 to 1958, when it was finally dissolved. He served as a member of the historic Coussey Constitutional Committee in 1950, whose constitutional proposals provided the roadmap for Ghana’s independence in 1957.

The late Tolon Naa was a special member for the Northern Territories in the Legislative Assembly of the Gold Coast in 1950. He won the 1954 and 1956 parliamentary elections for Dagomba South, first as an independent candidate and, then, as the candidate of the Northern Peoples Party. He remained in Parliament until 1965.

In 1954, he participated in one of the seminal events of the new Ghana – the formation of the Northern Peoples Party, which was established to advance the interests of the North in the new political atmosphere of the 1950s. Together with other great political personalities of the time such as S.D Dombo, Mumuni Bawumia and J.A. Braimah, Yakubu Tali helped draw up the constitution of the new party, which was approved by the delegates; officers were elected; and various local branches established. He was specifically tasked to build a solid machinery for the Northern Peoples Party in the great Dagbon Kingdom, a task he successfully executed, which led to the organisation of the first congress of the Northern Peoples Party here in Tolon on the 10th of April, 1954. The party was outdoored the following day, the 11th of April, the very day, 60 years ago, on which we are holding this commemoration. The distinguished S.D Dombo was elected Chairman and the highly respected Mumuni Bawumia, the father of my brilliant running mate, Mahamudu Bawumia, was elected Vice Chairman, with Fuseini Dramani as General Secretary, and the fearless Imoro Salifu as Propaganda Secretary.
Alhaji Yakubu Tali was a very effective and eloquent debater. It was not for nothing that he was known as the Golden Voice of the North because of the clarity and fluency of his expositions. He was a frequent visitor to my father’s house, and I had the privilege, as a young man, of listening to that memorable, unforgettable voice. He worked closely with political giants like the late Mr Victor Owusu of most blessed memory, then MP for Agona Kwabre. He later became Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly in July 1960. He was a member of the Ghanaian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1960, 61 and 69. 

After leaving Parliament in 1965, he embarked on a new career as a diplomat. He was appointed Ghana’s High Commissioner to Nigeria from 1965 to 1968. He was Ghana’s Ambassador to the then Yugoslavia during the Second Republic. In 1972, he was recalled and appointed Ghana’s High Commissioner to Sierra Leone, and was also accredited to Guinea as an Ambassador. He was a member of the 1979 Constituent Assembly, which prepared the Constitution of the short-lived Third Republic. He was a founding member and the first National Chairman of the Popular Front Party, PFP. Victor Owusu selected him as his running mate for the 1979 presidential election, which, unfortunately, they lost, thereby depriving our nation of a potentially great presidential team. 

Ladies and gentlemen, you will all agree with me that this was a great man who led a full and varied life, worthy of celebration. Politician, diplomat and statesman, Alhaji Yakubu Tali was also a chief of high traditional standing. An educated and cultivated man, he was an admired teacher of many of the young Northerners of the time. He was a person of deep-seated faith, a trait respected by all. He was a true embodiment of the dignity of tradition and chieftaincy in Ghana. He skilfully blended his faith, tradition and public service much to the admiration of his contemporaries. He belongs to the ages and represented the best elements of this noble tradition, the Danquah-Dombo-Busia political tradition of Ghana, reflecting integrity, loyalty to principle, selflessness, and commitment to honest public service in the highest degree.

We, therefore, have a duty, as beneficiaries of their toils and as loyal members of the political tradition these great men left behind, to be part of the celebration of the life of the Tolon Naa, Alhaji Yakubu Tali. As we commemorate the life of this noble Ghanaian from the North, I want to use the occasion to remember and recognise as well his compatriots from the North for their individual and collective sacrifices to the building of modern Ghana. We will continue to hold S.D Dombo, Mumuni Bawumia, J.A Braimah, Imoro Salifu, Jato Kaleo, Naa Abayifa Karbo, B.K Adama, C.K Tedam, who, happily, is still with us and Chair of this occasion, and the many others in high esteem. Pioneers in the struggle, against great odds, to establish Ghana as a democracy, where there is respect for the principles of democratic accountability, human rights and the rule of law, their labour has not been in vain. It is bearing fruit. They traced the path that our nation is following today. May their souls, and the soul of Alhaji Yakubu Tali, Tolon Naa, continue to rest in perfect peace in the bosom of the Almighty.

Nana Addo was met at the Tamale Airport and ushered through the principal streets of Tamale by thousands of NPP supporters clad in party paraphernalia, with over 500 motorbikes leading the procession.

There were chants of ""No Nana, No Vote"" and ""Shei Nana"", to wit ""unless Nana”, by residents of Tamale who had lined up along the streets of Tamale, making it emphatically clear that Nana Akufo-Addo is the man to rescue Ghana from the hardships and hopelessness the country is currently finds herself in.",2014-04-10T18:12:32+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/nakufoaddo/photos/a.10152314779794836.1073741870.7893934835/10152314781014836/?type=3,Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo added 22 new photos to the album: Akufo-Addo Arrives In Tamale For Congress — with Amankwah Enock and 18 others.,120,23,59,202
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"AKUFO-ADDO CALLS FOR PEACEFUL, SUCCESSFUL CONFERENCE
 
Fellow members and delegates of the New Patriotic Party, this weekend marks an important milestone in the history and future of our great Party.
 
For the second time at our Party’s National Delegates’ Conference, over 5,000 delegates will gather at the Tamale sports stadium in Tamale this Saturday to elect national officers to steer the affairs of the Party for a four year term. No other party in our country has been anywhere near as bold in extending power to its rank and file, and I expect none will do so in the foreseeable future.
 
Our task in Tamale, on April 12, 2014, is simple but critical: to choose a team of capable national officers who will lead us, as a united force, to recapture power in the 2016 general elections. The NPP rank and file deserve a leadership which will provide, with urgency, a clear and credible strategic plan for achieving this purpose.
 
We have done very well over the last four months, under challenging conditions, to hold, across the length and breadth of the country, nearly 26,000 democratic elections to choose some 140,000 officers to prosecute our 2016 campaign.
 
In spite of the challenges, the high level of participation, energy, zeal and camaraderie that these series of elections generated among our party activists across the country should leave the nation in no doubt that the NPP is coming back – stronger, more united, with a highly motivated grassroots organisation.
 
In this regard, I respectfully appeal to all delegates to vote for efficient candidates, who can collectively enhance the image and fortunes of the Party in every region of the land.
 
In the well-known spirit of our Party’s democratic credentials, let us have peaceful, free and fair elections. All well-meaning party members wish to see the successes that we chalked in the polling station, constituency and regional elections repeated at this weekend’s National Delegates’ Conference. And, further, that, in line with our tradition, both winners and losers come together after the elections to promote the unity and fortunes of our Party. We expect from the elected team two things: ensuring the unity of the Party and leading us to victory in 2016.
 
The Ghanaian people are looking to us, in the NPP, to provide a clear, strong direction to deliver them from the increasing hardships and hopelessness they have been plunged into by the Mahama-led NDC administration. We need to restore hope and confidence in our young people; we need to restore hope and confidence in the leadership of the nation. We must therefore, accordingly, conduct ourselves in a winsome manner.
 
Once again, I wish to congratulate all the new party officers from the polling stations, electoral areas, through the constituencies to the regions and external branches and wish them the very best. And, I also commend all former executives across the country for their service and dedication to the cause of the Party over the years. I reiterate my appeal to them to stay engaged in the activities of the Party.
 
May God bless our Party, our country Ghana, and us all.

However well-meaning they may be, our region cannot make the bold transforming changes it needs to make without visionary political leadership.

We need leadership, not just in politics, but also in the professions like Medicine and Science, Technology and Industry, Business and Law.

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""Political leaders must encourage such entrepreneurs to look first to our region and then to build transparent, competitive relationships that can accelerate our development. The possibilities are endless. Just a small example: think with me for a moment about the prospects of Ghana selling $2 billion worth of salt to Nigeria and the ripple effects that volume of trade in such a simple commodity, which Nigeria now imports from other continents, can have on our economies.

It might seem to you in Nigeria that with your oil you are operating in a larger world market already and do not need the region. It might seem to us in Ghana that with our newly discovered oil we can join the big league on our own. Maybe we should be keeping one eye on the news about fracking and the real possibility that the dynamics of energy economy might be about to change dramatically. Ten years ago it was envisioned that, by 2015, Africa would account for 25% of all US crude oil imports. Today we know that with the onset of fracking or hydraulic fracturing, the US and Canada and the UK are able to tap unconventional oil and gas deposits, thus reducing substantially their dependence on petroleum imports. In other words, our oil might no longer be the black gold it used to be. It is the responsibility of innovative leadership to think ahead and be ready for the changes that lie ahead.

When we think of West Africa and Africa before our individual countries, we are not just being pan-Africanists, we are being true nationalists, because what makes West Africa better will make each of our individual countries better and more prosperous.""

That is why, for my part, I made and will continue to make education the foundation for my vision to build a knowledge-based, industrialised economy in Ghana. Access to free, universal, quality, basic education is the key to participation in the new global economy. Our human potential has not yet been developed to match and capitalize on the exploitation of our continent’s rich resources. Until we bridge this gap, we cannot compete successfully in the global market and we cannot create dignified and confident societies.""

Ask yourself why? Our development partners are refusing to release funds to support our budget, ask yourself why? Salaries are in arrears, ask yourself why? Unlike what we are witnessing today, what Ghana needs is a government that makes the issue of giving value for money the underlining principle for managing public funds. We need that to develop greater confidence in the economy. 

I have learnt a lot in my four decades in frontline politics. I continue to learn. I have made mistakes in my life, I have said things I could on hindsight have put better. I have tasted defeats and also chalked some successes. I have played my part to see multiparty democracy becoming entrenched in our nation. I was part of President Kufuor’s team that demonstrated to our people that a liberal democracy can deliver on laying the foundations for economic prosperity. I want to be part of winning the next challenge: which is to build a modern, industrialised  society in Ghana, where every citizen has the opportunity to prosper. This is the driving force of my life. I will stay true to what I believe in, no matter the pressures to do what is convenient. 

I am clear and convinced about the direction in which we must go as a country. I have been consistent on this because I believe in it. 
I am convinced Ghana can do better than this current state of affairs. And, I believe we can make the change that will make us better than this. We have unfinished business. And, I am ready to get back to work.

The 2012 Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has met the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana (PCG), Rt. Rev. Professor Emmanuel Martey, at his office in Accra.

As part of a series of meetings to inform stakeholders in country about the decision he has taken regarding his political future, Nana Addo’s meeting with Rt. Rev. Professor Emmanuel Martey was also to inform the latter about his arrival in Ghana.
       
Nana Addo said it was important that even before his much anticipated announcement on Thursday, March 20, certain key persons in the country are informed directly on the decision he has taken regarding his political future.

Rt. Rev. Professor Emmanuel Martey prayed for God’s blessings for Nana Akufo-Addo as he embarks on the next chapter of his political career, admonishing him to, as he has always done, put God first in all of his endeavours.

Nana Addo was accompanied by Hon. William Ofori Boafo, the NPP Member of Parliament for Akropong.

In a related development, Nana Akufo-Addo has also called on the National Chief Imam, Sheikh Dr. Osman Nuhu Sharubutu, at his residence in New Fadama, Accra.

Accompanied by former Greater Accra Regional Minister, Sheikh I.C. Quaye and former Accra Metropolitan Authority boss, Stanley Adjiri Blankson, Nana Addo’s visit was to officially inform the Chief Imam of his arrival in the country, after a six month break from active politics.

Nana Addo also took the opportunity to inform the Chief Imam on the decision he had taken regarding the next step of his political career ahead of the Thursday, March 20, declaration.   

Sheikh Dr. Osman Nuhu Sharubutu, on his part, gave thanks to Allah for Nana Akufo-Addo’s safe arrival to Ghana. He urged Nana Addo to remain focussed and be guided by his vision for the country ahead of Thursday’s declaration.",2014-03-19T21:15:54+0000,status,NA,NA,857,288,45,1190

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo this afternoon paid a courtesy call on the Paramount Chief of Osu Traditional Area, Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI, at the Osu Palace.
 
Accompanied by Sheikh I.C. Quaye, former Greater Accra Regional Chairman; Prof. Mike Oquaye, former 2nd Deputy Speaker of Parliament; Stanley Adjiri Blankson, former Accra Metropolitan Authority boss; Ishmael Ashitey, Nana Addo's call on the Osu Mantse forms part of a series stakeholder meetings he has undertaken since he arrived in Ghana.
 
Presenting four bottles of schnapps and an undisclosed sum of money to the Osu Mantse, Nana Akufo-Addo explained to the Osu Mantse that the purpose of his call was to announce formally his arrival into the country after taking a brief break from active politics.
 
Ordinarily, Nana Addo stressed that the Osu Mantse being his ""landlord and brother-in-law"" should have been his first point of call after arriving from London. He, however, indicated that circumstances beyond his control had prevented him from calling on the Osu Mantse immediately after his arrival.
 
Nana Addo thanked the Osu Mantse and the four clans for the honour done him by granting him audience to address them. He showered praise on Nii Okwei Kinka Duwuona VI for the role he played in ensuring that all the 4 clans in Osu had united, which has translated into the peace, development Osu is currently witnessing under his reign.
 
Nana Addo further assured the Osu Mantse that contrary to propaganda that made the rounds when he was outside the country, stating that he was sick and resorted to the use of a walking stick, he was fit and very healthy.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo also took the opportunity to personally inform Nii Okwei Kinka Duwuona VI regarding the decision he has made on his political future ahead of Thursday’s announcement.
 
Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI, on his part, thanked Nana Addo and his team for the reverence he has shown his ""landlords"" by calling on them. Just as is being depicted in Osu, Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI, urged that unity was the only way forward for Ghana if she is to achieve its developmental goals. The Osu Mantse noted that Nana Addo was looking much younger and sprightful than ever, despite the propaganda that had made the rounds in his absence.
 
After pouring libation, Nuumo Gbelenfo III in his remarks decried the side-lining of “traditional religion” at official state functions. He bemoaned how Wulomei are no longer invited to play any role on Independence Day ceremonies and other state functions under the present government.
 
He asked Nana Akufo-Addo not to repeat this unfortunate development should he become President in 2016.
 
He further urged Nana Addo to open his doors continuously to the people of Osu, adding that ""if you live well with us, we will also live well with you and have your best interests at heart.""",2014-03-19T18:19:55+0000,status,NA,NA,707,189,34,930

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""There is a lot that is right about Ghana and about us, as Ghanaians. We are enjoying the longest period of stability since 1957. We are a democratic nation with a God-fearing people proud of their freedoms. Our country is rich in human and mineral resources. We can draw on a significant number of educated, hardworking and enterprising people, both at home and abroad. Ours is a nation with a positive international image on a continent that is finally but slowly being taken seriously. We are hailed as a model of democracy and stability in our region. We have a young, dynamic population ready to define their own destiny. What they want are the opportunities to grow and make it happen.

We must re-imagine what Ghana can be like in the 21st century and re-dedicate ourselves to building that new Ghana. We can build a United Ghana even in a fiercely competitive democratic environment. A Ghana where there is tolerance and mutual respect for divergent views, where religious freedom is stoutly championed. A Ghana where politicians do not exploit our ethnic differences for electoral gains. A Ghana where rules are obeyed by both leaders and the led.

Our country has everything it needs to progress. Ghana is ready and so must its leaders be. I am confident that the future for Ghana is brighter than the dream of 1957 and I know that this century is the era of our manifestation.

God bless Ghana ! God bless Africa ! God bless us all ! Thank you.""

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""It is about our society and its value system. It is about our individual and collective commitment to Ghana’s wellbeing. How strong do we live by our values? And what are these values, really? We must garner the courage to elevate the operative principles and standards of our society. After all our daily prayers and finger pointing, why do we allow the paying of bribes to be a tolerable social behavior? So far we have devalued our values to allow people to get away with it. It is time to be deliberate in setting a higher bar for ourselves and, especially, for our leaders.We can succeed if we build a stronger sense of national pride, a greater sense of unity, a stricter sense of responsibility, and a richer sense of genuine ownership among Ghanaians. In our homes, in our communities, in our workplaces, we must encourage the development of a set of patriotic values that push us to do more; reward creativity and success, and, above all, make the creation of an equitable society of opportunities and aspirations for every Ghanaian, irrespective of the circumstances of birth, the bedrock of our nation building. We must build and be seen to be building a Ghana for all Ghanaians.I say this because we need to maintain hope and confidence of our people in the capacity of our democracy to deliver. Leaders from all fronts of our society should do more to let Ghanaians know that public leadership is a vehicle for the pursuit of the common good and not for self-enrichment. And, I want to see that paradigm shift in my lifetime.""

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""Today’s digital revolution and the fierce pace of technology mean that knowledge, skills, technology, creativity and capital have become very mobile, making them more important in determining where production takes place rather than the location of natural resources. How ready are we, though, to meet the challenge to our ability to promote national prosperity and protect national security, knowing all too well that the biggest threat to our social and political stability is the phenomenon of widespread youth unemployment. As one travels across the villages, towns and cities of Ghana, one cannot help but notice the large numbers of able-bodied young persons who are idle. This is a consequence of a failed educational system that does not provide them with the requisite skills and a structurally rigid economy that simply cannot generate the large pool of good jobs with good pay. It will be suicidal on the part of policy makers if they do not act with urgency to address this crucial matter.""

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"""A paramount concern of our time has to be the consolidation of Ghanaian democracy, requiring the strengthening of our institutions of state, particularly, in their capacity to deliver results and to be accountable to the people. The most direct way of so doing is for all Ghanaians to accept to play by the rules we have set for ourselves in our national constitution and in our laws. Playing by the rules also means enforcing those very rules. By this, we can deal with corruption and abuse and theft of public funds. It is critical to the process of recalibrating the course of Ghana’s progress. We must have a public sector that is efficient in delivering universal access to good quality education, healthcare, legal remedies, personal security and basic infrastructure.""

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"Akufo-Addo has not bowed out

The attention of the Office of Nana Akufo-Addo has been drawn to a story published on Ghanaweb today, Friday, 21 February, 2014, and sourced to the Al-Hajj newspaper, with the headline: ‘Akufo Addo bows out, Kufuor Agrees’.

It reads: “Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, who is cooling off in his ‘hide out’ in far-away UK has finally thrown in the towel on his wildly rumored third term bid for the presidency due to old age and health concerns.”
 
We wish to assure the good people of Ghana that the story is entirely false. This alleged news item only exemplifies the unacceptable face of creative journalism which seems to be the specialty of the Al Hajj newspaper.
 
Nana Akufo-Addo has made no such decision. As indicated before his departure to London last September, he will make known his future in Ghanaian politics on his return to Ghana, which will be very shortly.

I learnt they were both in London and took the opportunity to invite them to discuss the future of the New Patriotic Party, the problems confronting the ordinary people of our country and how to work together, as a party, for victory in 2016. I was very encouraged by the sincerity and respect that the two men showed to each other and their commitment to plan and work together to secure the victory that we seek in 2016 in order to begin the necessary process of restoring hope to the people of Ghana with a government that works for them. I will urge all those who have competed or are competing for party positions to learn from the wonderful example of these two NPP loyalists. We have an exciting future ahead of us!

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,"In the last two months, our party, the New Patriotic Party, has held elections in some 26,000 polling stations across the country, followed by constituency executives elections in most places. With very few notable exceptions, the exercise has been successful. The generally peaceful, united, free and fair manner in which the polls were conducted served as an encouraging testimony to the NPP's democratic culture and a neat exhibition of the spirit of oneness that the NPP needs. It must continue and we must consciously let peace and unity within the NPP serve as our constant guide.

I congratulate all members of the party who participated in the various elections held so far. For those who lost, I wish you better luck next time and, more importantly, I urge you to stay fully engaged in our efforts to reorganise the party for the general elections of 2016. For those who won, please reach out to bring on board every member and supporter of the party in our efforts towards a strong and effective campaign for a clear and resounding victory in 2016. We need unity now to reinforce our front to offer a more attractive and competent alternative to the people of Ghana.

I will urge that any issues arising from these party elections be resolved amicably and expeditiously in a fair and transparent manner, using the existing internal party procedures. Protecting the integrity of the organization, whiles addressing all legitimate issues, is the way to go. The NPP has an enviable democratic tradition of encouraging free and lively competition, and exchange of ideas and views among members. Let us protect and project this tradition by keeping our competing or opposing views on the way forward decent and constructive. 

My message to the rank and file of the party is that we must never lose focus of what it is that is at stake: the destiny of our dear country and how to enhance the lives of ordinary Ghanaians. The task ahead is to win power and be so declared in 2016 so that we can give the people of Ghana the governance, which they deserve. 

Let us stay united even as we compete amongst ourselves. We cannot compromise on the unity of the party if we are not to compromise on the victory that we seek. We must, therefore, see these internal contests as but a necessary reorganisation process that we must first go through. Let us keep it clean and convivial so that we can all get back together, to think together, work together and secure victory together in 2016.

I know 2013 had its fair share of disappointments for many of us. But, by God's grace, we sailed through to its end. 

Let us welcome 2014 with renewed optimism. That we may find solutions to the difficulties of 2013. That we may triumph against the new challenges of 2014. That we may turn the anxieties of 2013 into opportunities in 2014. 

In all that we do, let us put our nation first. Let us work harder and better, individually and collectively, to make our economy healthier and our nation stronger. 

Let us pray for those who lead us so that they may find the humility, compassion, competence and confidence to serve us and serve us well. 

Let us all protect our integrity, serve our nation with selflessness, and keep our focus on the greater good, which is to strive and strive to create a free and prosperous society of opportunities for every Ghanaian, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, or social status. 

Let us continue to believe in Ghana by doing our bit to achieve the Ghana that we desire.

John Dramani Mahama,"In 2015, the UN approved a new set of global targets known as the SDGs. With these new targets, as African leaders, we have our work cut out for us. 

I recommend that attention must be focused on those SDGs that pertain to Africa particularly. I believe there are seven of these goals Africa must pay particular attention to. 

These are SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 16.

SDG 1 aims at ending poverty in all its forms. This goal is actually a continuation of goal 1 of the MDGs. It is possible for Africa to build on the tremendous success achieved in halving poverty under the MDGs to achieve this SDG goal. 

Social protection programmes aimed at wealth redistribution and poverty reduction drew large segments of our population out of poverty.  We need to build on this achievement.

SDG 2 aims at ending hunger. Africa has a comparative advantage when it comes to agriculture. We have not sufficiently leveraged this advantage. The time for Africa’s green revolution is now. 

Public and private investments in agriculture and agribusiness must be encouraged. It is said that Africa holds up to 15% reserves of the worlds arable lands.  

These lands must be put to good use to end hunger and create jobs. Modernizing agriculture is a must. Scientific agricultural production using improved seeds, mechanization and irrigation is absolutely essential. 

The mass of African agriculture is rain-fed and based on small holder production. Medium to large scale farmers must be encouraged utilizing modern agriculture technology. 

Small holder productivity must also be enhanced by using modern methods of production. In Ghana a new concept of farmers’ service centres (FSC) introduced by my administration will help advance modernization of agriculture and increase food production to eliminate hunger.

SDG 3 aims at universal health care. Health it is said is wealth and a healthy nation makes a wealthy nation. Under the MDGs much progress was made in promoting healthcare across Africa. 

Maternal mortality rates are on a downward trend. Women must not be a statistic. 
As African leaders we must work to ensure that no woman dies in the process of carrying out her natural role of procreation. All children must survive childbirth and under-5 mortalities must be brought to zero. In Ghana, our intervention in achieving universal healthcare has been on a three (3)-pronged approach. 
1. Improving and extending health facilities, major referral hospitals, Health Centres and CHPS compounds. 
2. Training adequate Professional personnel to provide service in the health facilities. 
3. Improving and expanding the Health Insurance scheme in order to ensure coverage for all.

SDG 4 aims at creating opportunity for all to achieve equitable quality education. For Africa the focus should be to aim for universal secondary school completion, and also prioritize acquisition of skills through TVET. 

With this in view, during my term in office, I began the single largest programme for expansion of secondary education in Ghana. We began the construction of 200 new secondary schools across the country mostly in underserved rural communities.

SDG 7 aims at access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all. This is perhaps the most binding constraint to African growth and development. 

All across the continent from Cape Town to Cairo, African economic growth is stunted by a lack of access to adequate power. Part of the reason for the slow down of Ghana’s growth was a lack of adequate power. In recent years we have had to go through a crippling load management programme popularly referred to in Ghana as ‘dumsor’. 

Aggressive emergency expansion of generation which saw a fast track deployment of 850MW of power, and the commencement of utilization of significant offshore gas wells has given Ghana, once gain, the prospect of becoming a major exporter of power in the sub region. 

Happily, this is the story across the continent. As I travel around I see new transmission lines and generating plants coming up. With the support of the AfDB and other financial institutions, additional megawatts of conventional and renewable energy are being pumped into Africa. 

SDG 9 aims at building resilient infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. Building domestic and regional infrastructure stimulates economic activity and in turn spurs growth. 

Investment in infrastructure spending is rising. From Rwanda, through Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Cote D’Ivoire to Morocco, one can see significant investments being made in roads, ports, railways, bridges, airports, ICT and telecommunications and other critical economic infrastructure. 

SDG 16 aims at promoting inclusive societies for sustainable development and effective accountable institutions. This goal encourages us to build societies that create opportunity for all. In which no segment of the society is left behind. 

This relates to governance and democratic consolidation.  Africa has turned the corner when it comes to the issue of democracy and good governance. 

All sovereignty must be built on the will of the people. Democracy, transparency, free expression and participation of the people in their governance unleashes the creative potential of the citizens. 

It is a force for good and helps to ensure sustainable progress. Progress achieved under transparent democratic systems are more sustainable than compliance exacted under unconstitutional governments or dictatorships. 

Democracy is not a one size fits all exercise. Democracy evolves and is not imposed. Countries must progress on the path of democracy according to their own cultural and demographic peculiarities. 

A free, objective, impartial and accurate media is a desirable component of democratic consolidation. Civil society organizations, active traditional authorities and religious leaders all constitute a positive addition to democratic consolidation. 

ECOWAS has earned plaudits for its recent intervention in the Gambia to uphold the will of the Gambian people in the December 01 elections. While this represents a positive out-turn of a regional determination to uphold our charter on democracy and good governance, such intervention may not represent a blue print applicable in all circumstances. 

Under this goal we must strengthen our governance institutions and make them accountable. Systems and legislation to deepen the fight against corruption must be established. 

How can Africa win the progress race, I believe that in addition to the above, Africa must form beneficial partnerships with all regions of the world. But above all Africa must form a partnership with itself. We must go beyond playing lip service to regional integration.
Barriers to free trade and investment across the continent continues to be a major constraint to Africa’s progress and growth. Traditional trade flows established by the colonization of the continent have been maintained after many decades of independence. 

Continental trade estimated at an average of 12-15% is abysmal. Comparative figures for North America is 40%, and EU 60%.  We must guarantee the free movement of people, goods and services across the continent.  

This can only result in a win win situation for all. Taking down barriers to trade will create a larger playing field for African Entrepreneurs and will dramatically expand cross border investments. 

Africa as a market has a population of over one billion people. A fast growing middle class with increasing disposable income is a most attractive prospect for investment. 

The full benefits of this positive aspect of Africa’s demography can only be realised in a situation of borders open to trade.

John Dramani Mahama,"Ignore claims about President Mahama’s residence 

Contrary to the claims being made that HE John Dramani Mahama, former President of the Republic of Ghana, has refused to vacate his residence, we wish to state and confirm that per the information officially communicated to the newly inaugurated administration following discussions by the Joint Transition Team, President Mahama will continue to maintain his current place of residence as his retirement home. 

The decision and agreement on the place of residence and office for the former President was formally communicated to the new administration by the former Chief of Staff Julius Debrah on December 19, 2016.                 

The Sixth Parliament of the 4th Republic before its dissolution, also resolved that residential and office accommodation should be provided to the outgoing President, HE John Dramani Mahama in line with convention and existing  precedent.

The claims that Vice President Dr. Mahamadu Bawumia is stranded and has nowhere to stay, is mischievous and deliberately intended to embarrass President Mahama. 

The  Vice President is expected to take up residence in the House known as Australia House, which was previously occupied by former Vice President Kwesi Bekoe Amissah-Arthur. 

An Official and Permanent residence for the Vice President is currently under construction, off the Switchback road. Dr. Bawumia will move into the new structure when completed.

TO REMAIN CALM AS RESULTS TRICKLE IN

The John Mahama 2016 Campaign wishes to congratulate its teeming supporters, sympathisers and the voting public for the impressive turnout to vote for President John Dramani Mahama today. 

We recognise also, that the voting process was very smooth and orderly. Voters comported themselves well, despite some isolated incidents and delayed start of voting at a number of polling stations. 

We do also acknowledge the decision of the Electoral Commission to extend voting in the Afram Plains South Constituency and re-opening of the polls in Jaman North Constituency tomorrow. 

We wish to also encourage our supporters to continue to remain calm as the ballots make their way to the constituency collation centres. At this moment, a number of radio stations are announcing polling station results, and not constituency tallies. 

With the details we have from our Parallel Vote Tabulation, President John Dramani Mahama is in a comfortable lead, and we encourage all supporters to wait for the Electoral Commission as it receives and releases the verified results to the media via its Coalition & Media Centres. 

Let us continue to ignore and treat with contempt, claims by some radio and TV stations announcing who is leading the pack or winning the election based on polling station results that do not equate to a total of three (3) constituencies. 

We thank you for your confidence in the John Dramani Mahama administration and for your vote.

John Dramani Mahama,"My vision is to transform Ghana into the most important, the most inclusive and the most inspirational democracy in Africa in my second and final term, God willing. To achieve this fundamental goal, we need to create more jobs. We need a more vibrant economy, where opportunities grow for everybody and where success stories embolden the young ones to dream big.  

Together with a new NDC Government, I will deliver the most ambitious job creation plan for our country. We will implement the Economic Transformation and Livelihood Empowerment Programme (ETLEP), an Initiative that will generate at least three million direct and indirect jobs.

John Dramani Mahama,"Ladies and Gentlemen,
The environment is getting better and better, and the right climate for take-off is here. This is why in my second and final term starting January 2017, God Willing, I am determined to implement an Economic Transformation and Livelihood Empowerment Programme (ETLEP).  

This programme seeks to create more jobs in several sectors of the economy, with private sector involvement, and is anchored on value addition and diversification on the back of sustainable power supply.

The Economic Transformation and Livelihood Empowerment Programme will strengthen existing industries and pay particular attention to the entire agriculture value chain.

Additionally, the Programme will provide more jobs for the youth and Ghanaians as a whole, improve disposable income and enhance their purchasing power.",2016-08-20T23:58:29+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/JDMahama/photos/a.477609928916835.109615.472991836045311/1310205022323984/?type=3,John Dramani Mahama added 3 new photos.,4368,501,455,5324

More and more women are taking part in the decision making process both at the local and national level in Ghana today. I know we still have a lot to do, but I am confident that Ghanaian women will get more and more empowered. I will forever be their ally in their fight for more justice, more equality and more dignity.

Together, we have achieved many great things, some of which seemed impossible four years ago. For example, work has started on the Bolgatanga- Bawku road just as we delivered the Sawla- Fufulso Road.

John Dramani Mahama,"My brothers and sisters in the NDC, once again, happy birthday! Ours is a party that made history, and will continue to make history. Our tradition returned Ghana to democracy in 1992 and we continued to widen Ghanaian democracy ever since – so much so that today, because of our vision and dedication, Ghana is the fifth most democratic country in Africa.

Democracy is in our DNA! Last year over one million of our party members took part in our internal elections. This proves not only that in NDC everyone has a voice, but also that our party keeps transforming in a continuous effort to better itself. And we are on course to transform Ghana. 

My brothers and sisters, ours is a party for the people, where everyone is welcome: poor and rich, women and men, young and old. No matter your situation in life, no matter your tribe or your gender, NDC will always offer you equal opportunity and equal treatment. 

This sense of unity among equals gives us strength! It also places upon us a great responsibility- we have to honor NDC’s proud and positive history by offering every Ghanaian a proud future! We all share this honoring responsibility for our fellow-party members, for the party itself, and for every Ghanaian. This is precisely what NDC stands for, and we should never forget that!

John Dramani Mahama,"Once again, we are in the ninth month on the Islamic calendar – the holy month of Ramadan dedicated to fasting, prayer and alms-giving as commanded by the Holy Prophet Muhammed (Peace Be Upon Him). 

This spiritual time of introspection and self-restraint also requires of all Muslims to welcome each new day by sacrificing their earthly desires of food, water and other worldly pleasures for the spiritual life of prayer, alms-giving and the general realisation of God’s presence in all places and at all times.

A higher form of spiritual life is demonstrated by our Muslim brothers and sisters during this period with ever more reverent practices of virtue espoused by almost all religions. 

This fosters a period in which compassion and empathy leads the devout Muslim to the realisation that he/she cannot sit in one corner unconcerned about the wellbeing of his/her neighbours and friends but as a religious command must reach out in charity and goodwill.

There is a beautiful story in a famous book Kimiya-e Sa’dat written by Imam al-Ghazzali of which a certain Shaykh [Junayd al-Baghdadi] gave his disciples a fowl each and asked them to kill it in a place where no one could see them. His numerous disciples all returned after killing their fowls except one who returned with a live fowl. When the Shaykh asked why, the humble disciple replied, “I could not find a place where Allah would not see me.”

This exemplary story should prompt us to at all times conduct ourselves in a manner that acknowledges the presence of our maker. And there is no better time to observe this than during the holy month of Ramadan where peaceful coexistence with neighbours and friends is ubiquitous.

True to the injunction by the Holy Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) that Muslims should be ambassadors of peace and love to the world, our Muslim brothers and sisters, like the followers of the other religions, have contributed tremendously to the peace and security that has provided the foundation upon, which our nation Ghana is rapidly developing.

Indeed, I am in no doubt that in the whole world, we Ghanaians in particular, practice Islam in its truest and purest form, and as President, I am proud to preside over a country where there is perfect peaceful co-existence among people of different religious faiths.

As a nation, we have always welcomed this period with great anticipation due to the increased solidarity and goodwill that manifests among others.

At this time Muslims set the tone for piety across our villages, towns and cities; and all others join in, ensuring that the country experiences the peace that Islam promises.

Our new National Mosque, which will soon be commissioned, will serve as the custodian of the tenets of this beautiful religion and help us shut-out the doors to extremists' influence of radicalisation and terrorism. 

I appeal to my Muslim brothers and sisters that during this month of Ramadan they should remember to pray to Allah to open the windows of heaven and shower on us his choicest blessings and also grant us a more peaceful 7th General Elections than we have ever witnessed.

May Allah answer our prayers and may his Peace envelope this Nation.

It allows us to get in touch with each other more easily, to receive and spread information, and co-ordinate among ourselves without having to rely on already existing organizations. Through social media, we all get a voice in our democratic conversation.

Like any other type of freedom, however, some use it to create and spread falsehood. While I do love creativity, I don’t think this is the most useful way to be creative- false realities are a waste of time and energy. Fortunately though, social media also allows some opportunity to separate the truth from the lie by giving us the chance to check the facts.

John Dramani Mahama,"So, at Komenda on Monday, we inaugurated the New Komenda Sugar Factory, an important infrastructure and economic project. I am happy that after many decades, Ghana can start producing sugar again, reducing the amount of sugar we import while creating economic opportunities for our local people and farmers.

Following our very detailed and exhaustive discussions in Cabinet this morning, we approved the steps taken by the Ministry of Power, and expect the Taskforce, which comprises the Energy Commission, the ECG, the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) and other stakeholders to submit its report and solution on June 03, 2016 for immediate implementation.

John Dramani Mahama,"My brothers and sisters, today we celebrate Mother Africa. Over the last decade, African countries, like our beloved Ghana, have been working to improve further our democratic credentials and economic prospects. 

I am happy that Ghana continues to lead this effort and is impacting our subregion and the continent. This in itself is ensuring a powerful and positive impact on the wellbeing of millions and millions of people.

Africa is rising, there is no question about that. We are rising from violence and dictatorship to peace and democracy; we are transforming our economies from those based on the export of raw materials to modern ones, able to produce value added goods and services; we are rising from misery and absolute poverty to a place of hope and improved standards of living. 

The African middle class is the fastest growing middle class in the world today. 

Of course, things are far from perfect in Africa, and we still have a long way to go, especially when it comes to sustainable solutions for our youth. However, our voice is now stronger and more respected in the world. We no longer need sympathy – we need fair partnerships and opportunities.

Let us all continue on this path of transformation. Let us all keep working hard for a better future for our generation and the generations yet to come. 

Let us all unite in our common prayer for a more open and inclusive Africa, where everyone would live a dignified and meaningful life.

John Dramani Mahama,"I have been in Japan over the last three days, and I am happy to convey on behalf of my countrymen and women, our appreciation to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the people of Japan for the restoration of the Yen Loan Portfolio, which was cancelled in the year 2000. 

Following our discussions, the Government of Japan has agreed to finance at the cost of ¥11.2 billion, our request for a new bridge over the Volta River, which is part of our eastern corridor road network and will be critical in improving transportation between the Northern part of Ghana and the South.

Japan is also financing the construction of the second phase of the Sekondi Fishing Harbour project, and a ¥2.3 billion Advanced Research Centre for Infectious Diseases at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at Legon. 

More of our young people will also benefit from scholarships to study under the ABE Initiative. All these will contribute greatly to the expansion of our country’s infrastructure and human resource to boost further growth. They also mean more new jobs in the near future, and more so, a transformational impact on our economy, with a significant multiplier effect.

John Dramani Mahama,"As the saying goes in Japan, “Keizoku wa chikara nari”, meaning Continuance is strength. This Japanese proverb resonated in my mind when I was driven into the Imperial Palace in Tokyo with my wife, Lordina, for my second opportunity to meet and interact with Emperor Akihito and his wife, Empress Michiko. 

The proverb became more relevant after our discussions and as my thoughts went back to my very first time in Tokyo as a young staff of the Japanese Embassy in Accra. 

Japan is indeed a living proof that an ambitious and creative people can rise again from its own ashes. For me, this Japanese rebirth has always been an inspiration, and I do believe we all have a lot to learn from their experience and the maintenance of their culture and traditions in a dynamic and evolving way.

Ghana, like Japan, has had its share of challenges and hard times, but we have always been able to overcome them through hard work, perseverance and vision.

John Dramani Mahama,"My friends, when I met with fellow Ghanaians in London recently, I shared with them my thoughts about the present and the future of our country. 

Let me use this opportunity to share the same thoughts with all of you. 

I'm not saying I've made Ghana a paradise, but I'm building on what I inherited from my predecessors and I'm taking it to the next level. In four years, I cannot fix everything, but I will take the steps that continue to fix the problems we've identified. That is why Ghana is changing and at a reasonable speed. 

I am investing massively in infrastructure to help make access to healthcare, education, potable water and electricity easier and better. 

Through these, we have and will continue to create more jobs and work to transform our economy into a fully fledged middle income country. 

There is still a lot of work to do, so let’s keep moving forward!

John Dramani Mahama,"I participated in the UK-organised anti-corruption summit in London yesterday. Ghana is present at this summit as one of the most successful democracies in Africa, and I had the opportunity to share our story with other leaders and engaged in some media interactions.  

If you didn’t know already, I am happy to inform you that we are now, officially, the fifth democracy in Africa. In the prestigious Democracy Index 2015, we were ranked 53rd in the world, a leap of no less than 15 places since 2014. This significant leap offers others inspiration and hope.

Our democratic success in the last four years is - and will continue to be - doubled by our success in the fight against corruption. This summit offers us the opportunity to find new, innovative solutions, and also to showcase the important steps we have been taking to fight corruption.

For me, it is of paramount importance that we move forward Ghana’s anti-corruption agenda as contained in the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (2015-2024) and our commitments under the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). 

Our hard work, our vision and dedication earned us a well-deserved place in the community of nations.

John Dramani Mahama,"I spoke about ""Rising Opportunities..."" in our beloved country in a speech at the University of Cape Coast last Thursday. In that speech, I outlined to the audience how Ghana has started changing over the last few years in line with my government's Agenda for Transformation. 

Wherever I visit during my travels across the country, I see a nation filled with an energetic, innovative and promising youth, ready and willing to take advantage of the rising opportunities government is creating together with the private sector.

Our Country, Ghana, is changing and the change is solid and transformational because it is backed by the implementation of sound and deliberate policies and programmes which I am leading as President.

This change is not by accident. We are doing the right things. And that is why I commend you for your sacrifices, fortitude and hard work over the period.

John Dramani Mahama,"""I was 3 years old, and my father sent for me to come to Accra from the Northern village where I used to live with my mother. We were in this car, my mother and I, and my father’s driver kept driving as if all this was perfectly normal. We were sitting in the back of the car. She was silent, she kept looking over the window – and I was lost. I thought the world was going to end. I knew that once we arrived in Accra she would return to her village up in the north. I thought I would never see her again.

And then slowly, very slowly, I gradually began to understand how deep my mother’s love for me was. I understood that she will always be there for me, no matter what. Suddenly, the silence stopped being frightening. It became warm like a promise that everything was going to be alright.""

This is for my mother, Abiba Nnaba, and for all Ghanaian mothers. 
May God bless you every single day, from the day you were born till the end of eternity! 
May the patient, unconditional, unselfish love with which you protect us and believe in us return to you even stronger, even wider!

This is why everything we have achieved so far - better access to education, better access to water and electricity, better access to medical facilities, better roads, better agriculture - is, first and foremost, your achievement. 

You contributed decisively to our common effort, and it is only fair for you to be rewarded accordingly. Thanks to you, our economy is currently expanding and will grow even more significantly in 2017. This will most certainly mean more jobs and more money into your pockets.

A ticking youth bulge requires that we speed up the process of economic growth in order that we can provide decent jobs for the large number of young people graduating from our schools. Accelerated economic growth, expansion of manufacturing and agriculture will guarantee jobs and stop the risky flow of young Africans across the Mediterranean in search of new opportunities in Europe.""

John Dramani Mahama,"The young people of this country are our most important transformational force. But they need support, and one of my top priorities was, and will continue to be, to provide such support.

In addition to many already introduced interventions including the YES Initiative, the Skills Development Fund and the new Youth Employment Agency, I have just launched a new project to construct new facilities for 10 Technical Institutes across the country. This will position the Institutes to deliver quality technical and vocational training to our young people. 

Across the nation, 1,050 students have also been awarded bursaries in various technical and vocational institutions. This is to make it possible for them to continue and complete their technical education. 2000 apprentices have been awarded with bursaries in the informal sector that allows them to be placed in industry and learn on the job to qualify as master craftsmen, and later set up their own workshops.

As a symbol of this deepened partnership, President Erdogan and I cut the sod for a new project, the Terminal 3 building at the Kotoka International Airport.

It is with this belief that I took office as President four years ago, and it is with this same belief that last week I delivered my State of the Nation Address.

The opposition is exercising its democratic right to criticize, which is a proof that we are living in a healthy democracy. However, it would be wrong to try to minimize our achievements and the depth of Ghana’s transformation in the last three years. For me, as President, these last three years are a story of hope– a hope shared by so many of us. This is because what we have been able to achieve so far is for all of us, and it was made possible only through the continuous participation of all of us.

The most important fact about the transformative stories I shared last week, the most fundamental truth about them is that they are not my achievements, they are our achievements! 
They are Ghana’s achievements! 

Step by step, we built something important, something that lays the foundation for irreversible improvements in the lives of all of us! We worked hard every day, we kept the faith, we kept moving forward – this is how we achieved all this!

Iran has always been a close friend and supporter of the freedom movement in Africa, and supported the fight against colonialism and apartheid.

John Dramani Mahama,"Transparency International has released its annual Corruption Perception Index for 2015. Ghana ranked 56th out of 167 countries and territories, with an overall score of 47. Although the score is slightly lower than the one for 2014, we moved upward when it comes to ranking, from 61st place in the world in 2014, to 56th place.
 
Our fight against corruption is visible. In 2008, Ghana was ranked 67th in the world, and in 2012 it was ranked 64th. Since 2008, we are constantly moving upward, towards the group of less corrupt countries, and that’s a fact. From 2012 until 2015, Ghana climbed up no less than 8 places in the world hierarchy – which, no matter what others might say, is an unparalleled achievement.
 
Ghana today is perceived as less corrupt than important countries like Italy, Greece, Brazil or China. More importantly, Ghana is one of the least corrupt countries in Africa.
 
Of course, we all know that we still have a lot to do when it comes to fighting corruption. All of us, not only the Government, should be more involved in this fight. 
 
Without a doubt, Ghana’s results clearly show that we’re on the right path. For this, I thank all of you. God bless you! God bless our Mother Ghana!

I think this cooperation is fundamental in order to achieve all the objectives that we set up in our agenda for transformation.

John Dramani Mahama,"As Co-Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Goals Advocates, I took the floor in Davos at the World Economic Forum 2016. 

I did it with a strong belief in what we, as leaders, have to do. We must work to ensure that the most basic things that so many of us take for granted, are available—not as a privilege, but as a human right—to the millions who currently do not have access to them.

I’m talking about things as basic as clean water and sanitation, health care, food, shelter, clothing and a chance at the one thing that can end the cycle of poverty for a family, a community, even a country—an education. 

The Sustainable Development Goals are the world’s collective admission of that duty. They are a covenant; yes, a social contract for transformation, and a path to bring hope to the world, especially to the less-privileged people.  

They are our understanding that in order for progress to continue, in order for peace to exist, we must first fix what has been broken in this world.",2016-01-25T13:20:36+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/JDMahama/photos/a.477609928916835.109615.472991836045311/1155651081112713/?type=3,John Dramani Mahama added 8 new photos.,19413,1256,700,21369

John Dramani Mahama,"I am Co-Chairing, together with the Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, a group of sixteen Sustainable Development Goals Advocates to support the Secretary General of the UN in his efforts to generate momentum and commitment to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

I am humbled by this appointment. To me, it speaks volumes about Ghana’s leadership on the path of sustainable development. It proves not only that we are on the right track, but also that we lead the way. The world is proud of us, and this makes me extremely proud of each and every one of you!

My appointment as Co-Chair of this select UN group also means that Ghana will be able to attract more foreign investments, which in turn will help boost the economy thus, significantly more jobs will become available for Ghanaians.

This is the future we all fought for, and I am honoured to be your leader in this fight!

John Dramani Mahama,"In order to gain new and useful insights, it is important that we listen to one another - truly listen. What I have seen happening too often is people dismissing the viewpoints of others without even listening to what it is they have to say. 

If we continue on this path, we run the risk of creating unnecessary divisions in our country—socially, ethnically, tribally, geographically, politically and even in the arena of religion and faith. And what we sometimes fail to hear is that we are all on the same side. We are all on the side of Ghana.

John Dramani Mahama,"173 Senior Secondary Schools across Ghana, plan to have universities in every region, 4 new modern hospitals under construction, numerous polyclinics, distribution of solar lamps to rural communities, the massive gas infrastructure at Atuabo, projected to save the country an estimated $500Million annually in fuel purchases for power plants, huge increases in water delivery to Ghanaians across the country: these are only some of our achievements during the last three years. 

No matter what some may say, these achievements are real, and they provide sustainable progress in everybody’s lives.

 When we empower people by offering them access to water, access to schools, hospitals and polyclinics, people see these things; they see how their lives have changed.

I spent the last weekend in Ho, with my officials. I challenged them to work harder only to build, but also to communicate with people about their work. There have been tremendous progress, and many more good things to come, so every Ghanaian should know about them, and feel proud about them.

My Brothers and Sisters

It gives me great pleasure to join you in bidding farewell to 2015 and welcoming a new year. This is a time for celebration, a time to express gratitude for the good fortune and blessings bestowed upon us throughout the course of this past year, not least of all, the blessings of good health and life itself.

This is also a time for contemplation and analysis. It is a time, as we move forward in our lives, to leave behind the setbacks and limitations of the past because with this New Year come new opportunities and the promises of limitless possibilities.
 
This is is true not only for us as individuals but for us as a nation.

They are already equipped to fight fires and other disasters within an average response time of 10 minutes, unlike the past average of 30 minutes.

It is very important for all of us to have a clear overall picture of our achievements, so that we know what remains to be done. In truth, I say to you, Ghana is on the path of recovery and our medium term prospects of becoming an upper middle income country are brighter now than ever in the history of our country.
 
These are Ghanaian achievements, and everyone should be proud of them. Let us all keep working hard.

In Ghana, we have been pondering on our options. We have been seriously considering which strategies would be the most viable, which strategies would realistically create change.    Through these discussions, what comes to light is that in our society the very concept of development is different than that in other societies. We must model our development on clean energy.    

Ghana has submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) on our climate change strategy and is determined to achieve ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases.  

Ghana seeks an agreement here in Paris that is binding, measurable and respected by all.

There is no place in our politics for violence. No amount of political power is worth shedding the drop of blood of any single Ghanaian. Politics is not a life and death struggle. Politics is live and let’s live, because this country belongs to all of us, it doesn’t belong to one group of people. So that is how we should handle our politics, by consensus, because we have the same objective.

All of us want the country to be a better place; it’s just that we differ in our approaches in how to do it. So it should not lead us to kill each other. 

I congratulate the people in the Upper West Region for their dedication and hard work. Let me assure all of you that all the good things we did will continue to be done, with even more passion and energy. We owe that to our fellow-Ghanaians!

John Dramani Mahama,"Last week I continued my #ChangingLives & #TransformingGhana Tour. This time, I met with the people of the Upper East region. I pledged to them that my government will continue to work hard to massively improve the quality of the road network in this region, and to build community high schools in every district. I assured them that their region is going to receive a fair share of development, as we work tirelessly to spread development to deprived and needy communities.

I also met with fellow-NDC members: I reminded all of them that NDC is a family, and as a family we will organize and support the primaries to be held on November 21. We have a moral duty towards all Ghanaians to win the next elections. While we keep transforming Ghana, we need to make sure that the benefits of this transformation are widely distributed, especially among the underprivileged. We owe Ghanaians to win this fight!

Our economy has been sufficiently transformed, during these last few years of necessary and often painful reforms, so that it won't fall prey anymore to low prices of commodities on the international market. Prices of commodities are still low, but our economy is getting back on track, as the World Bank’s forecast confirms. Our economy is changing!

John Dramani Mahama,"I always supported, and will always support the rule of law and our justice system. What we uncovered these days is that some people, judges, judicial officers and policemen, seemed to be willing to transgress the principles of a fair justice, to their own interest.

Such persons should be subjected to what they, perhaps, denied others: a fair investigation and a fair trial. Sometimes the principles are to be re-learned the hard way, because justice should always be served.

We must also understand that this is a problem of some people who may or may not be guilty: it’s for the investigators and the judges to decide. However, this is not a problem of our judicial system as a whole. This is not something to make us lose our faith in the judicial system. On the contrary, the investigations that began these days prove beyond doubt that our justice system is intact and working, served by many people with integrity and determination.

John Dramani Mahama,"""Our Agenda for Transformation as a country is kicking in, and I commit to the people of Ghana, that I will, as President, continue to focus on working to achieve that which we have set ourselves- that is transforming our economy to become a net exporter of goods rather than an importer. Today and here in Tema, we are inaugurating a new cocoa processing plant, which is a major contribution to our policy of processing at least 50% of our cocoa locally. Touton’s average annual trading in Ghanaian cocoa is about the value of US$350million. They will not only be spending $350 million annually on our cocoa but they have invested in a processing factory worth millions of dollars, and this comes with the associated benefits including employment of our hardworking youth and thereby improving the living conditions of our people. Again, the decision by Touton to choose Ghana out of the many countries in which it does business to build its first processing plant is another demonstration of the confidence that Touton has in the economy of Ghana.""

--- President JD Mahama speaking at a ceremony to inaugurate a new cocoa processing factory in the Tema Free Zones area on April 24, 2015.

John Dramani Mahama,"""Our public service must be noted for nothing other than Quality, Effective and Efficient Service Delivery. That is what I desire and that is what the people of Ghana desire from you. Accountability to the people is absolutely, absolutely necessary. Members of the public are not irritants. They are the reason for our being. That is why we are called the Public Service and that is why those who work in the Public Service are called Public Servants. It means you are servants of the public. So when the public interface with you, they have not come to irritate you, they have come to demand what is rightfully theirs, service. And that is the service we must give them. The public is the reason for our being and we must provide efficient and friendly service to them. The desired leadership of some organisations is low and lacking and it is necessary to conduct an occasional review and realignment of personnel.
We do it routinely for the political class. That is when I reshuffle ministers and there is no reason why we should not extend it to public service institutions.""

John Dramani Mahama,"The people of Zenu-Katamanso in the Greater Accra Region now have access to potable drinking water. The community, which is right behind Ashaiman, has never had pipe distribution lines. As part of the Kpong Water Supply Expansion Project, we have extended pipelines to the area and on Friday, I joined the chiefs and people to inaugurate the facility.

John Dramani Mahama,"I spent a greater part of Tuesday visiting and interacting with the management and staff of two aluminium companies, VALCO and ALUWORKS, which both require consistent power supply to operate at full capacity. VALCO is currently operating only one out of its 5 pots, which in turn affects the production capacity of ALUWORKS because it relies on VALCO for its raw materials. 

In addition to VALCO working to secure its own 450MW gas-fired plant, they have also prepared and are fully ready to operate a second pot once we are able to increase supply to them, when the current power supply challenge eases a little.  

The integrated aluminium industry holds great prospects for this country, and my discussions with VALCO outlined government's vision to roll out the integrated aluminium industry architecture.

John Dramani Mahama,"""Enclave Power is a private entity and has the concession to distribute power in the Free Zones enclave and they have been doing this since 2009.

Everywhere in the world, private sector participation in many areas hitherto monopolised by government is being encouraged. This is leading to increased investment from the financial sector and the capital market and it is introducing efficiency into the operations in those sectors.

Power can be no different. Therefore when people try to misinform the nation and the public by saying that our carrying out the reform in terms of allowing private sector participation in concessions and the distribution of power, by that we are privatising ECG, it is absolutely untrue.""

John Dramani Mahama,"""One of the issues we discussed with Chancellor Merkel was our agreement to send a letter to the UN Secretary General signed by Chancellor Merkel, the Norwegian Prime Minister and myself to suggest the setting up of an international panel of eminent persons to investigate the world’s international crisis response in terms of matters to do with health, like we had with the Ebola crisis. And the reason for that was to make it possible for the international community to respond much quicker and more efficiently than we did in the case of the recent Ebola outbreak. Just a few days ago I was very pleased to receive a response from the UN Secretary General accepting our proposal and indicating that the UN was going to work with us to set up such a panel and they hope that we would assist so that we can set up a better international crisis response system.""

John Dramani Mahama,"On Friday, I visited the Central Plant Pool of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, and handed over a number of equipment for routine road maintenance in our rural communities. These included 5 dozers, 20 trucks, 60 graders, 10 excavators and 20 loader.  

Our MMDAs will have access to the equipment, which will be stationed in three zones, for the construction of feeder roads, grading, upgrading and also for spot improvements. This will help ensure that the feeder roads in the communities remain motorable and can access the market centres from the farmlands.

So those prospects all look very good, it ties into my vision of increasing our power production to 5,000MW over the next few years. And I believe that once all these contracts are signed this year, all the companies that we have signed Memorandum of Understandings with for installation of IPP thermal plants will feel secure to go ahead because they know that by the time they finish their thermal projects, gas will be available to power those projects.""--- President John Mahama speaking during a visit to the Gas Processing Plant site at Atuabo in the Western Region on Tuesday September 02, 2014.

Some of these obstacles are the multiplicity of legal and illegal checkpoints and barriers, lengthy inspection times and documentation requirements, plus costly delays - regardless of whether documentation is complete or not. Many businesspeople of West Africa have been frustrated by the request for substantial informal payments at borders, in addition to the regulatory registration requirements and high costs of transit fees demanded by our Member States.

John Dramani Mahama,"Here is an excerpt from my speech at the National Prayer and Thanksgiving Service: In the Bible, there are many instances in which nations have brought supplications to the Almighty God, in times of tribulation and crisis. There are many occasions during which we – as a nation, Ghana – have called on God in times of crisis, and He has listened to us. We have been through periods of economic challenges. We have been through periods of drought and hunger. And in all these periods God has listened to us and has delivered us. Indeed, God has been good to us. We have natural resources. We have talented people. We have a beautiful environment. We have political stability. And above all, we have peace. What probably is lacking – and for which we pray that God grants us - is a singleness of purpose, a unity of mind and a oneness of our hearts. It is only with singleness of purpose and oneness of heart and working together that we can make progress as a nation. Let us eschew pessimism. We must count our blessings and our successes. And we must continuously ask God, “Why are we so blessed?” It is only with such a positive frame of mind that we can overcome any challenges facing us.

John Dramani Mahama,"My dear Ghanaians, brothers and sisters

Every year, when Easter comes, I think of the unique power of sacrifice. As fragile and useless it may seem sacrifice proves to be, over and over again, mankind's most powerful engine. Good parents sacrifice their present comfort for the future of their children. Real friends devote precious time and support to the ones they feel attached to. True heroes give their blood and endure humiliation for the sake of an idea or maybe for the birth of a nation.

Our Lord Jesus Christ sacrificed His life for all of us. He suffered atrocious torture for the future of all His children. He gave up His human time for our chance to eternity. He went to hell so we can all go to heaven.

This is love. This is the greatest love in our world history. We have a sacred example that we can follow and Easter tells us how magnificent the power of love is.

So, for this wonderful celebration, I want to tell you this, my dear Ghanaians: let's fight the selfishness in our minds. Let's help, as much as we can, the poor and the ill. Let's have patience with our children and play with them until they grow mature. Let's take care of our old parents and grandparents and remember that only their bodies age, not their souls. Let's work not only for tomorrow and not only for ourselves, but for our communities and our great country.

Let's love more.

I wish you all a Happy Easter! May God give you and your families warm hearts and understanding!",2014-04-18T13:18:16+0000,status,NA,NA,2390,1193,251,3834

John Dramani Mahama,"President John Dramani Mahama is in Parliament delivering the State of the Nation Address. His Excellency is very concerned about the challenges facing Ghanaians – especially recent issues with water, electricity and tariffs. Here are some talking points and messages: 

Energy: Compared to this same time last year, the electricity or energy situation is much better. It is not fully resolved yet, but we need to acknowledge that we have come a very long way. In fact Ghana’s electricity connectivity is among the best in Africa – probably only second to South Africa and/or Morocco.  Still, President Mahama is driving all the relevant officials and government entities to deliver on his objective to give energy security to Ghanaians.

Jobs: The President is very focused on creating jobs. He believes that when energy or electricity is stable then there would be a cascading effect in terms of private enterprise and jobs.

Infrastructure:
The Kwame Nkrumah Circle/Interchange Project has taken off.
More roads are being built and rehabilitated all over the country.
Jobs will be created through this as well.

The President would focus on the economy and how we can correct its fundamental structure. He believes we are doing the right but tough things now for a better tomorrow.  He is confident that with the commitment and dedication of every Ghanaian in a position of responsibility these challenges can and will be resolved soon. The President has decided not to play a popularity game with our economy but to pursue prosperity that lasts.

John Dramani Mahama,"Regarding the depreciation of the Ghana Cedi, I want you all to know two major things. First: this is not caused by our national decisions. We are part of the global financial system and so we share both its ups and downs.

Since the beginning of this year, several countries, with stronger economies than ours, have seen their currencies depreciating due to the moves of international players on the stock market. In January, for instance, Argentina's peso fell more than 20%, Turkish lira lost 6%, the South African rand fell 7% and so did the Russian ruble.

The second thing I want you to be sure of is that the government is aware of the effect this depreciation has on your lives. We take all the proper measures to enable the Cedi to regain its strength against the US dollar and other major currencies. This is a short term challenge and we will fix it.

John Dramani Mahama,"At Davos Economic Forum, I told the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, that Africa is now a better place to do business, so we encourage them to come and invest in our country.

Foreign investment is important, but growing the domestic private sector is also important. In the past, we were used to give incentives to foreign investors in order to come to invest, but not extending those incentives to our domestic private sector. I think that is changing now. With the new regulations that are coming out and the new laws that are coming out, we're extending incentives to both foreign investors and also to domestic investors. And so we're levelling the playground for everyone.",2014-01-23T17:58:24+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/JDMahama/photos/a.477609928916835.109615.472991836045311/731651030179389/?type=3,NA,1353,431,129,1913

John Dramani Mahama,"Here is a fragment from what I said at the World Economic Forum, in the session ""Africa's Next Billion"", where I took part together with Nigeria's president, H.E. Goodluck Jonathan.
""A new class of poor people was generated in Africa in the 70's and 80's, when we all went through structural adjustment programs. We were asked to withdraw all subsidies, especially to the poorest of the poor, who were in agriculture. We were not allowed to subsidize agriculture. And, yet, in the West agriculture was heavily subsidized. And so it made our economies heavily import dependent, for even food!, chicken and things that we have a comparative advantage to produce, to feed ourselves... Rice! If you look at the huge amount of money that was spent in my country, 500 million dollars every year, to import rice, while we have the capacity to grow enough rice to feed ourselves...
So I think that structural adjustment created some problems. Now, the international financial institutions agree with us. They say - oh, yes, you can subsidize your farmers. And so we're making a change, we're seeing agricultural production grow up, we're seeing farmers rising to the occasion, we're changing the orientation of our farmers from being just peasant producers into seeing agriculture as a business. So a lot of things are changing and we're doing social protection programs to make people feel inclusive...""",2014-01-22T18:14:21+0000,link,http://www.weforum.org/sessions/summary/africas-next-billion,NA,312,101,22,435

John Dramani Mahama,"President John Mahama today joined the generality of South Africans and the family of former South African President Nelson Mandela in praying for the Madiba ""in this critical stage of his life"", Information Minister Mahama Ayariga has disclosed. 

Speaking at the Daily Press Briefing at the Flagstaff House, Kanda, on Thursday, Mr. Ayariga said the President like others across the world is monitoring very closely the health situation of the former South African leader. 

Mr. Mandela has been in hospital for a recurring lung infection, and is said to be in critical condition. President Jacob Zuma has in his latest update on the former leader's condition assured South Africans that doctors were doing their best to ensure the wellbeing and comfort of the apartheid freedom fighter.",2013-06-27T21:46:01+0000,status,NA,NA,385,200,25,610
John Dramani Mahama,"Ghana has yet again been recognised for working hard to reduce hunger and undernourishment, from a prevalence of 40.5% in 1990-92 to less than 5% in 2010-2012. Ghana has therefore achieved the Millennium Development Goal One. 

The number of undernourished people in the country has also been reduced from 6.16 million people in 1990-92 to less than 2 million in 2010-12, achieving the rather ambitious World Food Summit target.  

At a special event held at the FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy, Ghana's progress was celebrated with an award for notable and outstanding progress in flighting hunger. 

Ghana was one of only eighteen countries in the world, and one out of only two that came from Africa to win the prestigious award. The reduction in the prevalence of hunger and undernourishment is based on the Food & Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) most recent estimates. 

Minister for Food & Agriculture Clement Kofi Humado received the award on behalf of President John Mahama at the Rome event. He was accompanied by three Best Farmers. 

Mr. Humado in his acknowledgement, attributed the progress made to the country's hardworking farmers and fishers. He also pledged the country's continued effort to eradicate hunger and undernourishment from the remaining pockets mainly in Northern and the Southern Savannah areas of the country.",2013-06-27T20:12:54+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/JDMahama/photos/a.477609928916835.109615.472991836045311/622456674432159/?type=3,John Dramani Mahama with Voice-Tozo Kokoroko and 3 others.,460,142,56,658

John Dramani Mahama,"President John Mahama on Monday received former German President Horst Kohler who is in Ghana to participate in an African- Europe Entrepreneurship Dialogue Series. 

The Series is aimed at harnessing job creation and forging a link between Europe and African countries. 

President Mahama used the opportunity to indicate that his administration is working to make it easier for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) to access credit. This he said will be done through partnership with the private sector. 

He also indicated that there is a new focus on technical and vocational education intended to train more middle-level human resource needed by employers and also position graduates to create jobs for themselves. The production of artisans will also reduce the over-reliance on the government sector.

President Mahama said the partnership meeting taking place in Accra is timely and critical considering the fact that Ghana is carrying out educational reforms that will now turn-out graduates faster than before. 

Former President Koehler said Ghana has the potential to become self-reliant in the near future and is the reason that was the reason why he was in the country with his team to leverage those potentials to an international level. 

He said the meeting will concentrate on job creation for the youth as that is paramount for every developing country to achieve its development goals.",2013-06-25T13:59:50+0000,link,http://www.flickr.com/photos/fhcommsbureau/sets/72157634322944728/,NA,123,51,6,180
John Dramani Mahama,"President John Dramani Mahama this morning joined the Mount Horeb Prayer Centre congregation to climax their 20th anniversary celebration at Mamfe in the Eastern Region. 

Accompanied by a number of government officials that have long years of association with the church, President Mahama spoke of the need to count one's blessings and acknowledge the progress in our lives. 

He likened the situation to the nation, Ghana, noting that the country continues to see progress and has moved from a 35% of people who are malnourished in 1992 to 5% today. According to him, one can best see the blessing and progress in his or her life when you review critically where you were and where you are now.

John Dramani Mahama,"Hello. 
I have spent a better part of Monday to this afternoon reviewing presentations from my ministers, the actual details of which I will be sharing with you next week. 
As you have been informed however, I will be meeting with British PM David Cameron at his request to discuss a number of key issues of both mutual interest and which will also advance the common positions we share as countries on matters of global interest. I am also looking forward to stating strongly the Ghanaian case when I join the G8 forum on tax, trade and transparency on Saturday. Ghana, your country has a good case, has a sellable proposition and as I have been doing, I will continue to push the Ghanaian case in my contribution at the G8 and meeting with PM Cameron. One other activity I am looking forward to is my lecture at the Chatham House at 5.30pm on Friday.

He added that the African Renaissance is on, and that Africa has achieved a lot in half a century. It was on April 15, 1958 in Accra that some African leaders and political activists gathered at what was called the first Conference of Independent African States. It was the first ever Pan-African conference to be held on African soil. It was that conference that called for the founding of an African Freedom Day, and five years later in Addis Ababa on May 25, 1963 thirty-two leaders of independent African States met to form the Organisation of African Unity.

John Dramani Mahama,"My wife, the First Lady, has sent out a message to all Ghanaian Mothers. The full message is below. 
--------------------------

As we celebrate yet another Mothers’ Day, there will be various gatherings both at home and elsewhere to honour and celebrate mothers for their hard work, love and dedication to their children. 

Some other Ghanaians will be honouring persons who are not their biological mothers, but who have filled the all-important role of a mother in their lives. 

Mothers are the homemakers. Mothers inspire us. They work hard and make lots of sacrifices to protect us their children and give us the opportunity to dream big about the future while helping us realize our ambitions. 

However old we are, our mothers deserve our gratitude and appreciation for their selfless and unconditional love. Mothers are the sweetest gift from God to us. There is no way we can ever really thank our mothers for all they continue to do for us. 

We must continue to remind ourselves of the various sacrifices they make, and keep them in our prayers while also celebrating them. We must reciprocate by respecting and show love to our mothers. It is their day today. Let us celebrate them. 

As a mother, I know the challenges and rewards of being both a mentor and a friend to my children. I am especially mindful of the exceptional commitment of single mothers, and mothers with special needs.

I salute all mothers today and I pray that you are able to celebrate with the mothers in your life.

Happy Mothers’ Day!

It is a 2MW plant, but as a pilot, it has opened the gateway for us to feed in hundreds more megawatts of renewable energy into the grid.  As our economy continues to grow at a rapid pace, the demand for power also increases at an even faster pace. We must put into the system at least 200 MW every year if we are to keep ahead of demand.

The two mega watts power plant is a fulfilment of government's renewable energy programme. In his State of the Nation Address in February this year, President Mahama announced that ""we are progressing steadily in the area of renewable energy"". 

Distribution of solar powered lamps as promised in the State of the Nation address has started. Government has also deployed some 10,000 units of solar home systems to off-grid homes in deprived communities and some national security and basic schools. 

A 315 kilowatts solar plant has also been completed by government for the Noguchi Memorial Institute at Legon with support from JICA. The solar power is expected to augment the energy requirements of the Institute.   

Thursday's inauguration of the 2MW solar power plant is however the first large scale power plant, constructed by the VRA to be fed into the national grid. It will be a major boost to government's renewal energy plan as it prepares to also focus on wind, biomass and waste to energy.

John Dramani Mahama,"First Lady, Mrs Lordina Dramani Mahama, has accepted an invitation to be an AIDS Ambassador to support the Heart to Heart (H2H) campaign, noting that government is committed to supporting the efforts of the Ghana AIDS Commission and the National AIDS Control Programme to achieve the target of zero new HIV infections, zero AIDS related deaths and discrimination. Mrs. Mahama made the commitment when the H2H Ambassadors, accompanied by the Director General of the Ghana AIDS Commission Dr. Angela El-Adas, paid a courtesy call on her on Tuesday. The First Lady, who was filled with emotion and excited to join the campaign, was also full of praise for the Ambassadors for their bravery, commitment to save life and dedication to the AIDS campaign to create awareness. She expressed her admiration for the AIDS Ambassadors for overcoming the stigma associated with the disease to launch the campaign and to appear on TV programmes to create awareness. “I admire you and am so proud of you”, Mrs. Mahama stated. The H2H ambassadors have been involved in public, TV and radio campaigns to change people’s perceptions of HIV and AIDS and reduce the stigma persons living with HIV face. According to the Director General of the Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC), the H2H campaign is aimed at providing a human face to HIV and AIDS through openly disclosing ones HIV positive status. Mrs. Mahama suggested to the Ambassadors and the GAC to evolve the campaign into the various local languages to reach many more Ghanaians. “Ghana AIDS Commission should make arrangements to train people who could administer the antiretroviral drug on people living with HIV” and not rely on the hospitals alone. In her view, nurses at various health facilities must also be encouraged to start educating people who visit there. <U+FFFC>She assured them that government considers it a priority to eliminate Mother to Child transmission of HIV, adding that his husband, President John Mahama is an avowed champion of that objective. Mrs. Mahama said as a lover of children she would personally support the work of the Commission to ensure that no child is born HIV positive, dies from the disease or is orphaned because of HIV. Dr. Angela El-Adas in her remarks said President Mahama has indicated his desire to make antiretroviral drugs free for people living with HIV. According to her, the President has also directed that after 31st March 2013 the service charge of GH¢5 for AIDS patients should be abolished. The Ambassadors took turns to share their experiences with the first lady as well as the challenges they face. Reverend Azumah and his wife Mrs Lydia Azumah recounted how they dealt with threats from the community, especially family members, when they first declared that they were HIV positive. Their families initially rejected them but with the campaign they embarked on, the attitudes towards them have changed. A former Fire Service Trainee, Gifty TorKornu, described how she overcame stigma at Church. “It was not easy going to Church, everybody was staring at me and that was the first stigma I had. The priest allowed me to talk to the congregation and since that day my life at the Church has changed; now the stigma is gone. I feel fulfilled doing the campaign.” Mrs Charity Owusu Danso was thankful to the AIDS campaign, which she says is responsible for the reduction in the stigmatisation of HIV persons. “The campaign has reduced much of the stigmatisation. I am doing the campaign not for money, but to save somebody”, she stated. They expressed concern that some pastors are now demanding HIV and AIDS test before blessing marriages and others deceiving patients to do away with the antiretroviral drug and to seek deliverance from the Church. The First Lady has also met with the UNAIDS Country Coordinator in Ghana, Girmay Haile, to discuss the UNAIDS support for HIV prevention in Ghana.",2013-04-11T07:32:11+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/JDMahama/photos/a.586741624670331.1073741833.472991836045311/586741638003663/?type=3,John Dramani Mahama added 7 new photos to the album: First Lady accepts AIDS Ambassadorial role — with Ibrahem Ibrahim Al Fayed and 6 others at Flagstaff House.,45,21,55,121

John Dramani Mahama,"President John Dramani Mahama on Monday filed his tax returns for the 2012 fiscal year at Kinbu of the Domestic Tax Revenue Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA). While this is not the first time he is filing his tax returns, President Mahama said he decided to make it public to whip up the enthusiasm of people to honour their tax obligations.  “All the good things that we want; the roads, utility services and others come from our taxes and we can only get them when we pay our taxes. I hope my symbolic gesture will help the Ghana Revenue Authority in their public education and awareness that everybody should pay their taxes”, he noted.   President Mahama further explained that “even as president, if you have any other income, apart from your official income, you are supposed to pay tax”.  In an interaction with the management of the GRA, the president pledged government’s commitment to providing the required logistics and other resources to assist their work.   “The health facilities, schools, roads and other infrastructural development we want in this country cannot be achieved without tax collection, and that is why we shall do everything possible to empower you to perform”, he noted.  He said the passing of legislations would help rope in more people and sectors into the tax net that would subsequently raise the Gross Domestic Product from the current 17 per cent to a higher percentage to enhance Ghana’s chances of becoming a middle income country. President Mahama appealed to the staff of the GRA to cooperate with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning to ensure smooth coordination that could speed up tax collection.  Commissioner General of the GRA, George Blankson, said the harmonization and modernization of the revenue authorities enabled them to collect a total of GHC1.7 billion Cedis as tax last year and hoped that with more modernization procedures they would perform better.",2013-04-02T14:35:59+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/JDMahama/photos/a.583331565011337.1073741830.472991836045311/583331605011333/?type=3,John Dramani Mahama added 3 new photos to the album: President Mahama files his tax returns — with Jacob A B PanAfrican and 3 others at Ministries.,58,14,78,150

President Mahama said, “the late Bolewura was a friend, brother, father and my strongest political supporter and counselor. In 2008, when I was contemplating leaving politics he was the one, who encouraged me to stay on."" 

His wish, according to the President was to see him rise to the highest office of the country. Mr. Mahama said he is happy that the Bolewura was at his investiture as the President of Ghana.

The National chief Imam led the Moslem prayers, Aduah, to commit the soul of the deceased chief to Allah. The late chief’s children and other dignitaries read tributes to his memory.

You have something to offer that will help move this country forward to its next anniversary.  It might just be a little change in your attitude to work; it might be an offer of help, however small, to others who need it. It might be the act of mobilizing for community action or volunteering at a hospital or clinic. Any and every contribution toward positive change is welcome.  No offer of service is too small or too big to make the necessary impact.  No single individual is too big or too small to be part of this process.""

At the beginning of this Session, I wish to seize this opportunity to pay tribute to that great statesman of our region, devoted to justice and peace, who not only placed all his energy at the service of the socio-economic development of his country, but also demonstrated his commitment to deepening our regional integration process and promoting the principles of democracy and good governance. 

Despite this unfortunate and unexpected turn of events, the country was able to maintain the stability and balance inherent in the running if its institutions. Ghana once again confirmed, through the last Presidential election held on 7 December 2012, THE DEGREE OF MATURITY AND ENTRENCHMENT OF ITS DEMOCRATIC CULTURE. Alongside the ECOWAS election observation mission deployed in that country, I particularly witnessed the climate of peace and the conditions of freedom and transparency within which the elections were conducted. 

It is within this context of proud achievement in our region that I congratulate H. E. John Dramani Mahama on his election to the highest office of his country. Excellency the President, on behalf of all ECOWAS Institutions, I would like to assure you of our commitment and determination to pursue, with your country and under your leadership, the efforts towards the stabilization of our region and deepening of our economic integration process.""

John Dramani Mahama,"President John Dramani Mahama has expressed satisfaction at works at the Kpong Water Plant which when completed is expected to solve the perennial water shortages in some areas in Accra.  He paid a working visit to the Kpong Water plant and called on the workers to speed up with works on the plant in order to meet set deadlines.  “There is a huge demand for water both for domestic and industrial purposes so we need to keep ahead the growth in demand. I am sure that this project, if we do phase one, bring in another 40 million gallons, we should immediately start working on phase two to increase to 80 million gallons.”  He opined that the rate at which the city is expanding, “if we don’t keep one step ahead, then always we will have problems with shortage. I can’t wait for this to come on stream because traditionally water starved areas in the city… and if this problem will be solved that permanently, I will sleep a very happy man.”  He also made a stop at the Weija plant to inspect the facility and promised government’s support to the Ghana Urban Water Limited (GUWL) to address current pressing challenges at the Weija Water treatment plant.  The President made the commitment when he paid a working visit to the  About two weeks ago, the water situation in Accra worsened when some filters at the plant got damaged.   The Managing Director of the GUWL, Senyo Amengor indicated that repair works on the filters are ongoing with one of them expected to be in full use within 28 days.   President Mahama described the service being rendered to Ghanaians by the water company as critical because according to him, “it is said that water is life and without water, no human being can exist and so the function that you provide for Ghana is the most critical function.”  He encouraged the workers to “do your work with happiness and produce so that Ghanaian people can have the benefit of the product that you give them.”  The President mentioned that he is well aware of the challenges the company is facing but promised to closely work together with them to solve the challenges.  “I’ve seen the problems with the filters and all that; we are going to work and fix the filters. This plant I am told is capable of producing 54 million gallons of water. We should be able to produce the maximum of 54 million gallons because Accra is a growing city.”  He also promised that the government will collaborate with company to cut the wastage in the system by improving on their transmission lines and others.  “Together with you, we are going to work so that we can improve the distribution system and improve your revenue collection system because if you are not collecting enough revenue, then it makes it difficult for you to continue to finance the maintenance and the servicing of this plant.”  Credit: CitiFM",2013-02-26T22:46:25+0000,photo,https://www.facebook.com/JDMahama/photos/a.567633283247832.125118.472991836045311/567633673247793/?type=3,John Dramani Mahama added 14 new photos to the album: JM tours Weija & Kpong water treatment plants — with Ohemaa Ama Sika and 11 others at Flagstaff House.,37,20,88,145

John Dramani Mahama,"Africa is making progress because of stability- JM

President John Dramani Mahama is confident that Africa will capitalize on the progress been made to open up a lot more opportunities for its citizens and investors. 

He has therefore encouraged Ghanaians and Africans in the diaspora to take advantage of the opportunities and “bring back home the experiences they have acquired over the years abroad.” 

President Mahama, who was contributing to a four-member discussion panel as part of the launch of the Olusegun Obasanjo Foundation in London, however adviced African in the diaspora to determine the gaps and expertise required in their home countries. 

“If you studied rocket science for example, we’ll have no job or opportunity for you in Ghana, because we aren’t getting ready to go into space, but there are many other areas, waste management, decentralisation, deployment of technology etc.” 

He noted that it is about time Africans take their destinies into their own hands in order to spearhead the development of the continent in the coming years.

Other panelists were Liberian President Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf, President Thomas Yayi Boni of Benin and President GoodLuck Jonathan of Nigeria.

President Mahama said although countries such as Mali, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic are still engrossed in destructive wars and disturbances, the continent in general has made some strides and is attracting more Foreign Direct Investment than any other continent in the past years.

The Olusegun Obasanjo Foundation, which was launched at the Grosvenor House in Central London, is aimed at ensuring nutrition and food security, eliminating youth unemployment, increasing awareness on girl child education and enhancing the elimination of non-communicable diseases in the continent.

The launch attracted, Heads of State, Non-Governmental Organizations and the business community from the African and European continents.

President Mahama suggested that in order to consolidate the gains made over the years, African leaders must invest heavily in education and skills training, promote entrepreneurial development and encourage their citizenry in the Diaspora to contribute their quota to the development of their countries.

“Africa is growing tremendously to the extent that out of the ten fastest growing companies in the world that are identified, six of them are coming from Africa.”

President Jonathan in his contribution said the government sector in many African countries is choked and advocated the promotion of private entrepreneurship that has the capacity to create more jobs for the youth and supplement the efforts of governments to dissuade borrowing from international financial institutions.

John Dramani Mahama,"Good afternoon, my dear friends. 
I arrived in London this morning to attend the launch of the Foundation of H. E. Olusegun Obasanjo, former Nigerian President. Only yesterday, I was with our own H. E. JJ Rawlings at the Flagstaff House and these former leaders are a store of knowledge and experience. 

I will, as part of the programme for the launch, join other colleagues including Goodluck Jonathan to discuss youth employment and why tackling it will help resolve many of the challenges facing Africa today. I am looking forward to the programme tonight. --JM",2013-02-08T12:02:49+0000,status,NA,NA,3492,2901,208,6601
